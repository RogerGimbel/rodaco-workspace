# Roger Gimbel

## Current
- **Role**: Developer at [[Rodaco]] (3-person company)

- **Access Level**: FULL ADMIN on OpenClaw
- **Partners**: [[Dale Abbott]], [[Stuart Seligman]]

## Context
- Solo developer handling all technical work for [[Rodaco]]
- Uses Claude Code, Lovable, Cursor, Replit, Bolt, Antigravity, Codex
- Manages home infrastructure ([[Raspberry Pi]] media stack, [[Intel MacBook]] server)
- Primary dev machine: [[M5 MacBook]] (MacBook Pro 14" M5, 32GB)
- Timezone: Mountain Time (Denver)

## Working Style
- Prefers concise, direct communication
- Sprint worker — intense bursts, then rest
- Does all coding himself — don't push coding assistance unless asked
- Decides project focus based on interest and priority (gut + importance)
- Wants to stay lean forever — no desire to build a big team
- Prefers TypeScript over plain JS (values linting, compile-time safety)

## Partnership with Dale
- 50/50 business partners since 1995 (on and off, recently back together)
- Roger leads tech, Dale leads business
- Dale is also very technical and interested in the tech side
- [[Ocean One Marine]]: Dale is 100% owner, Roger helping with tech
- [[BeerPair]]: 1/3 each (Roger, Dale, Stuart)

## Personal
- Lifelong futurist — on the bleeding edge of tech since his 20s
- Early career: built apps on HP handheld calculators for an ophthalmologist, used dBASE III for patient data analysis
- Stage 4 adrenocortical cancer survivor (diagnosed ~2010) — one of the most lethal cancers, ~10-15% five-year survival at stage 4. Took him out of tech for roughly 2010-2024.
- Now fully back and more driven than ever
- X (Twitter) is his #1 source for staying current — prefers it over Google for cutting-edge AI/tech info
- Follows developers, CEOs, CTOs at major companies on X
- Worst job ever: stuffing insulation in an attic
- If he could automate one thing in life: house cleaning (not a tech answer — a real life answer)

## Additional Projects (Lovable/Replit, various states)
- **[[BladeKeeper]]** — edge weapons collectors' web app
- **[[PhysioPal]]** — physio routine reminders for elderly/post-surgery (built for his father)
- **Supplement Tracker** — carnivore diet electrolyte/vitamin tracking (local storage, no backend)
