## Working Style
- Prefers concise, direct communication
- Sprint worker — intense bursts, then rest
- Does all coding himself — don't push coding assistance unless asked
- Decides project focus based on interest and priority (gut + importance)
- Wants to stay lean forever — no desire to build a big team
- Prefers TypeScript over plain JS (values linting, compile-time safety)

- Roger leads tech, Dale leads business
- Dale is also very technical and interested in the tech side
- [[Ocean One Marine]]: Dale is 100% owner, Roger helping with tech
- [[BeerPair]]: 1/3 each (Roger, Dale, Stuart)

## Personal
