# 2026-02-03 - Daily Log

## Overnight Build (5:08 AM ET)

### Media Stack Health Check
- **Status:** ✅ Mostly healthy
- **VPN:** ✅ Working (IP: 89.187.177.72)
- **Disk:** ✅ 33% used (569G / 1.8T available)
- **Unhealthy Containers:**
  - homarr - health check uses `curl` which isn't in container (config issue, not real failure)
  - wetty - internal service not responding on port 3000 (non-critical web terminal)
- **Critical Services:** All healthy (jellyfin, sonarr, radarr, prowlarr, qbittorrent, sabnzbd, etc.)

### Improvement Task: Container Image Updates
- **Attempted:** docker compose pull to check for updates
- **Issue:** SSH connection to Pi timed out during extended operation
- **Note:** Earlier health checks worked fine - likely momentary Tailscale connectivity issue
- **Status:** Deferred to next overnight build

### Claude Code Research: MCP Deep Dive
Updated `memory/claude-code-research.md` with:
- Tiered MCP server recommendations for Roger's workflow
- GitHub MCP server (HIGH priority for code review)
- Postgres MCP server (HIGH priority for Supabase queries)
- ✅ Web search solved via Grok 4.1 (no Brave/MCP needed)
- OpenClaw vs MCP comparison - what we already have vs what MCP would add
- Emerging AI assistant patterns (context management, multi-agent, memory architecture)

### Action Items Identified
1. ✅ Web search available via Grok 4.1 - no additional setup needed
2. **GitHub MCP** - would enable direct PR/issue management
3. **Fix homarr health check** - optional, use wget instead of curl
