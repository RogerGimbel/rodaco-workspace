**Source:** Agency proposal (20 pages)
**Date Analyzed:** 2026-01-30

## Agency Proposal Summary

### Budget Tiers (Monthly)
| Tier | Paid Media | Organic | Creative | Mgmt Fee | **Total** |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Good | $1,750 | $1,500 | $750 | $2,000 | **$6,000/mo** |
| Better | $3,500 | $1,500 | $1,500 | $2,000 | **$8,500/mo** |
| Best | $5,250 | $1,500 | $2,000 | $2,000 | **$10,750/mo** |

**Plus:** $1,500 one-time setup fee

### Their Strategy
- 90-day Meta (Instagram/Facebook) campaign
- Full-funnel: Awareness → Consideration → Conversion
- Geo-targeting craft beer cities (Tier 1: Portland ME, Asheville, Bend, Boulder, Denver, San Diego, Portland OR, Seattle, Chicago, Austin)
- CPI benchmarks: $2.70-$5.30 per install
- Focus on activation (not just installs)

### Content Pillars (Organic)
1. Pairing of the Week (save magnet)
2. Scan & Pair in the Wild
3. Learn to Pair (without snobbery)
4. Find It Near You (city hooks)
5. Community Prompts

### Creative Frameworks
- Scan & Pair POV demos
- Beer-first vs Food-first split-screen
- Pairing Wins ("Spicy tacos → drink this")
- Micro-learning (10-15 sec)
- UGC proof

## Critique

### What's Good
- Sound full-funnel strategy
- City-based targeting makes sense for craft beer
- Focus on activation over vanity installs
- Content pillars are solid and repeatable

### What's Overpriced
- $2,000/mo management fee (can DIY)
- $1,500/mo organic management (Rodaco can do this)
- Creative production (can bootstrap with phone + AI tools)
- $1,500 setup fee (standard SDK/tracking setup)

### What We Can Do Free/Cheap
- All organic content creation
- Community engagement
- Content scheduling
- SEO/ASO research
- Influencer outreach (manual but free)
- Most creative concepting

### What Actually Requires Money
- Paid ad spend (if we want paid)
- Professional video production (optional)
- Influencer payments (if we go that route)
