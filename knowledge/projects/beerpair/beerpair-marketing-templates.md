### Template 4: Spicy Food Challenge
```
🌶️ HOT TAKE: Most people pair spicy food with beer WRONG

The secret? DON'T fight fire with fire.

❌ Avoid: High-ABV, Bitter IPAs
(amplifies heat, harsh on the palate)

✅ Try: Wheat beers, Lagers, Cream Ales
(cool carbonation, slight sweetness tames spice)

Best spicy food pairings:
• Spicy Thai → Hefeweizen
• Buffalo Wings → Cream Ale
• Hot Curry → Kölsch
• Jalapeño Poppers → Mexican Lager
• Nashville Hot Chicken → Pilsner

The BeerPair app knows this science.

## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: The 3 Pairing Strategies
```
🧵 The 3 beer pairing strategies every food lover should know:

Most people guess. But there's actual science here. Let me break it down:

1/ COMPLEMENT
Match similar flavors to create harmony.
Example: Chocolate stout + chocolate cake
Why it works: Roasted malt mirrors cocoa richness

2/ CONTRAST
Use opposing flavors to create balance.
Example: IPA + fried chicken
Why it works: Bitter hops cut through greasy fat

3/ BALANCE
Find the sweet spot between complement and contrast.
Example: Amber ale + burger
Why it works: Malty sweetness enhances char without overpowering

4/ Pro tip: The BeerPair app uses all 3 strategies in its recommendations.

It analyzes your food's:
• Flavor intensity
• Fat content
• Spice level
• Cooking method
• Dominant tastes

Then suggests perfect pairings. Free download: [link]

5/ Try this tonight:
- If your meal is RICH (pasta, steak) → go CONTRAST (IPA, Pilsner)
- If your meal is LIGHT (salad, fish) → go COMPLEMENT (Wheat beer, Blonde ale)
- If your meal is BALANCED (pizza, burger) → go BALANCE (Amber, Pale ale)

That's it. You now know more about beer pairing than 90% of people.

Follow @beerpair for more tips 🍺
```

### Thread 2: Why Carbonation Matters
```
🧵 Why carbonation is the secret weapon of beer pairing (that nobody talks about)

You focus on flavor. But carbonation does the heavy lifting. Here's why:

1/ CARBONATION = PALATE CLEANSER
Those bubbles literally scrub your tongue between bites.
That's why beer + pizza feels so right.

2/ Fat is beer's worst enemy (in food).
Fat coats your tongue and blocks flavor receptors.
Carbonation breaks through that coating.

3/ This is why:
• IPA + fried chicken works
• Pilsner + french fries works
• Lager + nachos works

The bubbles are doing 50% of the work.

4/ Pro move: Match carbonation level to food richness

Light meal (salad) → Low carbonation (cask ale)
Medium meal (burger) → Medium carbonation (most beers)
Heavy meal (brisket, ribs) → High carbonation (Belgians, Pilsner)

5/ The BeerPair app factors this in automatically.
It considers:
✅ Carbonation level
✅ Food richness
✅ Flavor intensity
✅ Pairing strategy (complement/contrast)

Now you know why "whatever beer is cold" isn't good enough 🍺

## Reddit Response Templates

### Response 1: "What beer goes with pizza?"
```
Great question! Pizza is one of the easiest foods to pair because of the fat (cheese) + acid (tomato) combo.

**Best options:**
- **Pilsner or Lager** - Clean, crisp, high carbonation cuts through cheese richness
- **IPA** - If you have spicy toppings (pepperoni, jalapeños), the hop bitterness balances heat
- **Amber Ale** - If you have BBQ chicken or sweet toppings, the malty caramel notes complement

**Avoid:** Heavy stouts or high-ABV beers (they'll overpower the pizza)

If you want instant pairing suggestions for any food, I built a free app called BeerPair that uses AI to analyze flavor profiles. Just scan your meal and it suggests perfect matches. No affiliation, just genuinely helpful if you're into this stuff.
```

### Response 2: "Best beer for BBQ?"
```
BBQ is all about balancing smoke + fat + char. Here's what works:

**Ribs/Brisket → Brown Ale or Porter**
- Roasted malt mirrors smoky char
- Medium body stands up to richness
- Carbonation cuts through fat

**Pulled Pork → Amber Lager**
- Slightly sweet malt complements BBQ sauce
- Crisp finish refreshes palate

**Chicken → Wheat Beer**
- Lighter body won't overpower
- Citrus notes brighten the plate

**Pro tip:** Match beer intensity to meat intensity. Chicken = lighter beer. Brisket = darker beer.

I actually built an app (BeerPair) that does this analysis automatically - it considers cooking method, sauce, and sides. Free to use if you want precise recommendations.
```

### Response 3: "Beer pairing for spicy food?"
```
Spicy food + beer is tricky. Most people get it wrong.

**Don't:**
- High-ABV beers (alcohol amplifies heat)
- Bitter IPAs (bitterness + capsaicin = harsh)

**Do:**
- **Wheat beers** (Hefeweizen, Witbier) - Slight sweetness tames spice, carbonation cools
- **Lagers** (Mexican, Pilsner) - Clean, crisp, refreshing
- **Cream Ales** - Low bitterness, smooth, cooling

**Science:** Capsaicin (spice compound) binds to receptors. Carbonation + slight sweetness help neutralize it. Bitterness makes it worse.

**Specific examples:**
- Spicy Thai → Hefeweizen
- Buffalo wings → Cream Ale
- Hot curry → Kölsch
- Nashville hot chicken → Pilsner

If you want to nerd out on this, I built BeerPair (free app) that analyzes spice level and suggests ideal pairings. Works great for ethnic cuisines where spice varies dish-to-dish.

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Roger, creator of BeerPair.

**The problem:** Choosing beer for food is confusing. Most people guess or stick with "whatever's cold."

**The solution:** BeerPair uses AI to analyze your food and suggest perfect beer pairings in seconds.

**How it works:**
1. Scan or describe your meal
2. Get instant pairing recommendations
3. Learn WHY each pairing works (Complement, Contrast, or Balance)

**Why I built this:**
I love craft beer but got tired of guessing at restaurants. Bartenders are hit-or-miss. Google gives generic advice. I wanted something instant and smart.

**What makes it different:**
- Analyzes flavor intensity, fat content, spice level, cooking method
- Considers 3 pairing strategies (not just "this goes with that")
- Works for ANY food (not just common dishes)
- Free, no ads, genuinely helpful

**Try it and let me know what you think!**
Happy to answer questions and take feedback. This is v1 - lots more planned.

Cheers 🍺
Roger
