# BeerPair Integrated Marketing Plan: B2B Venue Strategy
## Complementing the Consumer (B2C) Growth Engine

**Created:** 2026-02-12  
**Purpose:** Merge venue/B2B revenue strategy with existing $0-budget consumer acquisition plan  
**Vision:** A flywheel where consumer adoption drives venue sales, and venue partnerships drive consumer awareness

---

## 1. Executive Summary

BeerPair's marketing operates on two reinforcing tracks:

- **B2C (Consumer):** Free organic strategy targeting 500+ app installs in 90 days via social media, SEO, Reddit, and influencer seeding — already documented in our [Free Marketing Plan](beerpair-free-marketing-plan.md).
- **B2B (Venue):** Revenue-generating strategy targeting breweries, taprooms, restaurants, and distributors with tiered SaaS subscriptions ($49–$3,000/mo).

These aren't separate strategies — they're a **flywheel**:
- More consumer users → stronger pitch to venues ("X users in your city already use BeerPair")
- More venue partners → more in-venue exposure → more consumer downloads
- More data from both → better pairing recommendations → higher retention on both sides

**Revenue Potential:** 50 venue clients at an average $150/mo = $7,500 MRR within 6 months.

## 2. Venue Market Analysis

### Budget Reality
| Segment | Monthly Marketing Budget | % of Revenue | Opportunity |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Breweries | $3,000–$10,000 | 5–10% | High — they invest in brand differentiation |
| Restaurants | $1,500–$7,000 | 3–6% | Medium — tighter margins, need clear ROI |
| Taprooms | $2,000–$5,000 | 4–8% | High — focused on experience |
| Brewpubs | $2,500–$8,000 | 5–9% | High — hybrid model, multiple upsell paths |

### Target Segments (Priority Order)
1. **Breweries with taprooms** — Most aligned, highest budgets, care about brand
2. **Craft-focused restaurants** — 10+ beer taps, food-forward menus
3. **Brewpubs** — Hybrid operations, strong food + beer programs
4. **Multi-location groups** — Enterprise deals, higher ACV
5. **Distributors** — Channel partner opportunity (access to hundreds of retailers)

### Opportunity Sizing
- ~9,500 craft breweries in the US (Brewers Association, 2025)
- ~60,000 restaurants with meaningful craft beer programs
- Even 0.1% penetration = 70 accounts → ~$10K+ MRR at blended pricing

## 3. B2B Pricing Model

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | Target | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Menu Magic** | $49/mo | Small restaurants, bars | Menu-ready pairing descriptions, seasonal updates |
| **Taproom Growth** | $149/mo | Taprooms, brewpubs | QR-code pairing experiences, staff cheat sheets, social content |
| **Brewery Pro** | $299/mo | Breweries, large restaurants | Full pairing program, custom branding, analytics dashboard |
| **Enterprise** | $1,000–$3,000/mo | Multi-location, distributors | White-label, API access, dedicated support, rollout kit |

### Pricing Rationale
- **Menu Magic at $49:** Below most venues' "no-brainer" threshold. If BeerPair increases average check by $0.25, it pays for itself on ~200 covers/month (most venues do 2,000+).
- **Taproom Growth at $149:** The QR experience and staff cheat sheets are the "sticky" features. Pays for itself at $0.50 lift on 300 covers.
- **Brewery Pro at $299:** Analytics and custom branding justify the jump. Comparable to a single social media tool subscription.
- **Enterprise:** Custom scoping. Distributors pay for retailer activation at scale.

## 4. Lead Generation Strategy

### The Free Pairing Audit (Primary Lead Magnet)

**Concept:** Venue uploads their menu → BeerPair instantly generates professional pairing recommendations for every dish.

**Funnel:**
```
Awareness → Land on Pairing Audit page
  → Upload menu (PDF, photo, or typed)
    → Instant AI-generated pairings delivered
      → "Want this on your menu? Here's how" CTA
        → Demo call or self-serve signup
```

**Why it works:**
- Zero risk for the venue (free, instant value)
- Demonstrates product capability immediately
- Creates a natural "wow, I want this" moment
- Captures venue contact info for follow-up

### Outreach Channel Mix

| Channel | % of Effort | Best For | Cadence |
|---------|------------|----------|---------|
| Instagram DMs | 40% | Breweries, taprooms | 10 DMs/day |
| Email | 30% | Restaurants, multi-location | 5 emails/day |
| Facebook Groups | 20% | Brewpub owners, craft beer communities | 3–5 posts/week |
| Phone | 10% | Enterprise, warm leads | As needed |

### Outreach Cadence (Per Lead)
- **Day 1:** Initial outreach (DM or email) with Free Pairing Audit offer
- **Day 3:** Follow-up with a sample pairing for one of their actual menu items
- **Day 7:** Share a case study or ROI data point
- **Day 14:** "Breakup" email — "No worries if timing isn't right, here's the audit link if you ever want it"
- **Day 30:** Re-engage with seasonal hook ("Summer menu coming up?")

## 5. Sales Playbook Summary

### The ROI Pitch
> "If BeerPair increases your average check by just $0.25, it pays for itself. Most venues see a $1–$3 lift per table when they add pairing recommendations."

### Key Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a beer menu" | "Great — we make it sell better. Pairing descriptions increase beer orders by 15–25%." |
| "Our staff knows beer" | "BeerPair makes every server a pairing expert, not just your beer geek. Consistency across shifts." |
| "Too expensive" | "At $49/mo, one extra beer sale per day covers it. You're probably leaving $500+/mo on the table." |
| "We're too small" | "Menu Magic was built for exactly your size. 10 minutes to set up, zero training needed." |
| "Let me think about it" | "Totally fair. Want me to run the free audit on your current menu? Zero commitment, you keep the results either way." |

### Demo Flow (15 minutes)
1. **Show the audit** — Run their actual menu through BeerPair (2 min)
2. **Highlight the output** — Menu-ready descriptions, staff cheat sheet preview (3 min)
3. **QR experience** — Show what their customer would see scanning a table QR code (3 min)
4. **ROI math** — Walk through their specific numbers (3 min)
5. **Pricing & next steps** — Recommend tier, offer trial (4 min)

## 6. Onboarding & Retention

### Onboarding Email Sequence (9 emails, 21 days)

### Retention Metrics
- **Health Score:** Login frequency + menu updates + QR scans
- **At-Risk Signals:** No login in 14 days, no menu update in 30 days, support ticket unanswered
- **Churn Prevention:** Automated re-engagement at risk signals, quarterly business review for Pro+, seasonal refresh reminders

### Upsell Path

- Taproom Growth → Brewery Pro: "Want analytics on what pairings drive the most orders?"
- Brewery Pro → Enterprise: Multi-location expansion

## 7. Distributor Strategy

### The Distributor Channel Opportunity
Distributors serve hundreds of retailers. One distributor partnership = access to their entire portfolio of venues.

### Distributor Activation Kit
1. **Retailer-facing sell sheet:** "Help your accounts sell more beer with AI pairings"
2. **Co-branded pairing guides:** Distributor's beer portfolio + BeerPair recommendations
3. **Rollout playbook:** How the distributor's sales reps introduce BeerPair to accounts
4. **Revenue share model:** Distributor earns referral commission on accounts they activate

### Distributor Pitch
> "Your reps already visit 50+ accounts per week. Give them a free tool that makes their accounts sell more of your beer. BeerPair generates pairing recommendations featuring YOUR portfolio."

### Activation Flow
1. Distributor signs partnership agreement
2. BeerPair builds custom pairing library for distributor's beer portfolio
3. Distributor reps offer Free Pairing Audit to their accounts
4. Accounts that convert → revenue share to distributor
5. Quarterly portfolio refresh as seasonal beers rotate

## 8. Integration with Consumer Plan

### The B2B ↔ B2C Flywheel

```
Consumer downloads app → Uses at venue → Venue sees engagement
    ↑                                          ↓
    ← Venue promotes app (QR, table tents) ←──┘
```

### Specific Integration Points

| Consumer (B2C) Action | Venue (B2B) Benefit |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| User scans menu at venue | Venue gets analytics on popular pairings |
| Instagram pairing post goes viral | Venue sees BeerPair brand awareness, easier sale |
| Blog post ranks for "beer + [food]" | Drives traffic that mentions venue partnerships |
| Reddit answer mentions local brewery | Brewery notices BeerPair, warms up for outreach |
| User base hits 1,000 in a city | "1,000 BeerPair users in Denver already" pitch data |

| Venue (B2B) Action | Consumer (B2C) Benefit |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Venue puts QR codes on tables | New users discover and download the app |
| Venue shares BeerPair on their social | Cross-promotion to venue's followers |
| Venue staff recommends app | Trusted word-of-mouth referral |
| Venue partnership announced | Content for social media + credibility |

### Shared Content Strategy
- **Venue spotlight posts** (B2C social) feature partner venues → drives foot traffic (B2B value)
- **"Pairing of the Week"** (B2C content pillar) can feature a partner venue's signature dish
- **Local content** (B2C) naturally mentions venue partners in city-specific posts
- **User-generated content** from venues becomes B2C social proof

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "BeerPair gives your venue AI-powered food and beer pairings — menu descriptions, QR experiences for customers, and staff training sheets. It takes 10 minutes to set up and pays for itself if you sell one extra beer per day. We already have [X] consumers using the app in your area."

### One-Line ROI
> "If BeerPair increases your check size by $0.25, it pays for itself. Most venues see $1–$3."

### Brand Voice (B2B)
Same as B2C — friendly, knowledgeable, not snobby — but slightly more professional:
- Lead with ROI and data
- Respect that venue owners are busy
- Never be pushy; always offer free value first
- Use their language: "covers," "check size," "ticket average," "taps"
