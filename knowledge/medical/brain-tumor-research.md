# Meningioma Research: Comprehensive Treatment Guide
**Compiled:** February 19, 2026  
**For:** Roger Gimbel — regarding his wife's diagnosis  
**Status:** Working document — will be updated as new information is gathered

## PATIENT-SPECIFIC MRI FINDINGS

**Tumor:** Extra-axial homogeneously enhancing mass  
**Location:** Left tentorial leaflet / left transverse-sigmoid sinus junction (posterior cranial fossa)  
**Size:** 2.2 cm × 3.0 cm × 1.8 cm (largest AP dimension 3.0 cm)  
**Key Complication:** Extension into/adjacent to the venous sinus — no definite occlusion noted  
**Additional findings:**  
- Mild reactive edema in adjacent occipital bone (common with dural-based tumors)  
- NO brain parenchymal edema  
- NO mass effect  
- NO hydrocephalus  
- Moderate chronic microangiopathic ischemic changes (separate finding — small vessel disease, age-related)  

**Patient:** Born April 1, 1965 (~age 60)  
**Presenting symptom:** Headaches

## WHAT THIS MRI ALMOST CERTAINLY MEANS

**The radiologic pattern is highly characteristic of a WHO Grade I (benign) meningioma:**

- Extra-axial location ✓ (outside brain tissue, on the meninges)
- Homogeneous enhancement ✓ (uniform contrast uptake = well-differentiated tumor)
- Dural-based with dural tail ✓ (typical meningioma fingerprint)
- No surrounding brain edema ✓ (aggressive tumors almost always cause edema)
- No irregular margins, no necrosis ✓

**Statistical reality:** ~83% of all meningiomas are Grade I. Homogeneous enhancement on MRI is one of the strongest predictors of benign grade. The radiologist and neurosurgeon will almost certainly confirm this when they see the scan.

**Prognosis context (for Grade I):**
- 5-year relative survival rate: ~87–97% (age-dependent)
- 10-year survival: >90% with successful treatment
- Recurrence after complete resection: 10–20% over 10 years
- Recurrence after radiosurgery alone: ~5–15% at 5 years

**The tumor is NOT growing into the brain.** It is pressing against it from outside, sitting on the tentorium and adjacent to the venous sinus. This is important for prognosis and treatment options.

---

## SECTION 1: UNDERSTANDING THE TUMOR LOCATION

### What is the Tentorium and Transverse/Sigmoid Sinus?

**The tentorium cerebelli** is a sheet of dura mater (tough membrane) that separates the cerebellum (back/lower brain) from the occipital lobes (upper/rear brain). It acts as a tent-like partition inside the skull.

**The transverse sinus** is one of the major venous sinuses — large, blood-filled channels that drain blood from the brain back toward the heart. The transverse sinus runs along the back of the skull, and the **sigmoid sinus** curves downward through the skull toward the jugular vein. These are not arteries — they are veins, but very important ones.

**Why this location matters:**
1. The tumor is in the **posterior cranial fossa** — the back/lower compartment of the skull
2. It sits at the **junction** where the transverse sinus transitions to the sigmoid sinus — a surgically complex zone
3. The sinus involvement is the central complication factor for surgical planning
4. This is a **skull base meningioma** variant — requires skull base surgical expertise

### What "Extension into the Venous Sinus" Means

The tumor has grown to abut or partially involve the wall of the transverse-sigmoid sinus. The key question (which surgery or further imaging will answer) is:
- Is the tumor growing **on the outer wall** of the sinus? (Better — may be resectable)
- Has it grown **through the sinus wall** into the lumen? (More complex)
- Is the sinus **still patent** (open/flowing)? (The MRI notes no definite occlusion — good sign)

**Why this is the central surgical dilemma:**
- The transverse/sigmoid sinus carries large volumes of venous blood from the brain
- Cutting or damaging a patent sinus during surgery can cause catastrophic hemorrhage or venous infarction
- Surgeons must decide: attempt complete resection (risking sinus) vs. subtotal resection (safer, then radiosurgery)
- If the sinus has spontaneously occluded (rare), it can be safely resected

**This is why MRV (MR Venography) will likely be ordered** — to map exactly how blood is flowing through the sinuses and whether there is collateral flow that would allow safe resection.

---

## SECTION 2: THE BIOPSY AND GRADING QUESTION

### Will She Need a Biopsy?

In most cases of **clearly radiologically typical meningioma**, a stand-alone biopsy is NOT done before treatment. The definitive diagnosis and grade come from:

1. **If surgery:** The tumor tissue is removed and sent to pathology. You get a diagnosis within 5–7 days.
2. **If radiosurgery:** Treatment proceeds without tissue diagnosis in most cases, as the radiologic appearance is highly reliable for Grade I
3. **MRI characteristics are so characteristic** that experienced neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons can diagnose meningioma with >95% accuracy

### What the Pathology Will Show (If Surgery)

**The neuropathologist will report:**
- **WHO Grade** (I, II, or III)
- **Histological subtype** (meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, etc. — all Grade I variants, largely irrelevant for treatment)
- **Ki-67 proliferation index** (cellular growth rate — low in Grade I, typically <4%)
- **Brain invasion** (present in Grade II by definition, absent in Grade I)
- **Mitotic figures** (cell division rate — elevated in higher grades)
- **Molecular markers** (NF2 mutation status, TERT promoter mutation, CDKN2A/B deletion — these refine prognosis)

**Modern 2021 WHO classification note:** The 2021 WHO reclassification added molecular markers. A "Grade I by histology" tumor with TERT promoter mutation is now reclassified as Grade III. A Grade I with brain invasion is now Grade II. This is why molecular pathology matters — ask for it.

### What Grade Means Clinically

| Grade | % of Cases | Description | 10-Year Recurrence | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Grade I | ~83% | Benign, slow-growing | 10–25% (after surgery) | Surgery ± observation; radiosurgery |
| Grade II | ~15% | Atypical, faster growth | 40–60% | Surgery + radiation usually required |
| Grade III | ~2% | Malignant, aggressive | 80%+ | Surgery + aggressive radiation, chemotherapy |

**Based on her MRI, Grade I is overwhelmingly most likely.**

---

## SECTION 3: CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS

### Option A: Watchful Waiting / Active Surveillance

**Who it's for:** Small, asymptomatic meningiomas, especially incidentally discovered  
**Protocol:** MRI every 3–6 months for first year, then annually if stable

**Is it appropriate for this patient?**
- She has **symptoms (headaches)** — this argues against watchful waiting
- At **3.0 cm**, she is above the typical threshold for surveillance (usually <3 cm, asymptomatic)
- Most neurosurgeons would recommend **treatment** at this size with symptoms

**Bottom line:** Watchful waiting is probably NOT the primary recommendation. It may be offered in limited circumstances but likely won't be the first choice.

---

### Option B: Surgery (Craniotomy)

**Standard neurosurgical approach:** Posterior fossa craniotomy / suboccipital craniotomy

**The surgical goal — Simpson Grading System:**
The Simpson Grade describes completeness of meningioma removal and predicts recurrence risk:

| Simpson Grade | What Was Removed | 10-Year Recurrence |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Grade I | Tumor + dural attachment + bone | ~9% |
| Grade II | Tumor + dural coagulation | ~19% |
| Grade III | Tumor only (dural not coagulated) | ~29% |
| Grade IV | Partial tumor (subtotal) | ~44% |
| Grade V | Biopsy only | Very high |

**For this patient's tumor:**
- Simpson Grade I (complete removal including sinus involvement) may be **impossible or very high-risk** given sinus involvement
- Most likely surgical scenario: **Simpson Grade II–IV** (intentional subtotal resection to preserve the sinus), followed by **radiosurgery to residual tumor**
- This is a very reasonable and commonly used strategy — not a failure, it's planned staged treatment

**Specific surgical considerations for tentorial/sigmoid sinus meningioma:**
- Requires a **skull base neurosurgeon** with posterior fossa experience — NOT a general neurosurgeon
- Neuronavigation (GPS for the brain) will be used
- Possible pre-operative cerebral angiography and **embolization** (blocking blood supply to tumor to reduce surgical bleeding)
- Patient positioning matters — usually sitting, lateral, or prone
- Possible use of **intraoperative monitoring** (cranial nerve function monitoring, SSEPs, MEPs)
- Average blood loss with sinus-adjacent tumors is higher; transfusion may be planned
- Hospital stay typically 3–7 days; recovery 4–8 weeks

**Risks specific to this location:**
- Posterior cranial nerve injury (cranial nerves IX, X, XI, XII) — affects swallowing, voice, shoulder function
- Cerebellar injury → balance, coordination issues
- Venous sinus injury → hemorrhage or venous infarction (the main surgical risk)
- Visual disturbance (occipital lobe)
- **Headache paradoxically may persist or worsen transiently after surgery**

**Pre-operative imaging to request:**
1. **MRV (MR Venography)** — maps venous anatomy, sinus patency, collateral flow
2. **CT Angiography or conventional cerebral angiography** — arterial supply mapping, embolization planning
3. **DOTATATE PET scan** — highly sensitive for meningioma, helps with extent of disease
4. **Functional MRI** — maps eloquent cortex near tumor

---

### Option C: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) — Primary Radiation Treatment

**What is it?** Highly focused radiation delivered in 1–5 sessions that precisely targets the tumor while sparing surrounding brain. Despite the name "surgery," there are no incisions.

**At 3.0 cm — Is radiosurgery viable?**

This is a critically important question. Traditional Gamma Knife guidelines have been:
- **<3 cm:** Excellent candidate for single-session SRS
- **3–4 cm:** Gray zone — may require staged treatment or fractionated approach
- **>4 cm:** Generally not suitable for single-session SRS

**Her tumor at 3.0 cm is at the upper boundary of single-session SRS.** Many centers would treat this, especially given the venous sinus involvement that makes surgery more complex.

#### Gamma Knife (GKRS)
- The original and most studied form of SRS for meningiomas
- 192–201 cobalt-60 radiation beams focused to a point
- Typical dose: 12–15 Gy to the tumor margin
- **Local control rate for Grade I meningioma at 5 years: 91–97%**
- Tumor may not disappear — often stabilizes or slowly involutes over 2–5 years
- **Optimal for:** Tumors <3 cm, skull base locations, post-surgical residual tumor
- Available at: Mayo Clinic, UCSF, Mass General, Johns Hopkins, Barrow, and many regional centers

#### CyberKnife (SBRT)
- Robot-mounted linear accelerator that tracks tumor in real-time
- Can treat in 1–5 fractions (sessions)
- More flexible for irregular tumor shapes
- **Fractionated CyberKnife** (e.g., 3×7 Gy = 21 Gy total) is a good option for her 3.0 cm tumor
- Can treat tumors adjacent to sensitive structures (optic nerve, brainstem, sinuses) more safely with fractionation
- Widely available

#### Proton Beam Therapy
- Uses protons rather than photons (X-rays)
- Delivers sharp dose falloff (Bragg peak) — potentially less radiation to surrounding brain
- **Advantage for her:** May be better for treating along the sinus where dose spillage to sinuses matters
- Requires 25–30 daily sessions (fractionated treatment)
- Limited availability: Mass General, Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, Penn Medicine, Loma Linda, etc.
- **Particularly considered for:** Larger tumors, tumors near sensitive structures, younger patients (less long-term radiation scatter)

#### Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT)
- Conventional radiation but with stereotactic precision and fractionated delivery
- Typically 25–30 sessions over 5–6 weeks
- Standard for tumors too large for single SRS, near optic pathways, or near critical vascular structures
- Effective control rate similar to surgery for many Grade I meningiomas

**Radiation-specific risks:**
- Radiation necrosis (rare but serious) — tissue death from radiation effects
- Edema around the tumor — usually managed with dexamethasone (steroid)
- Fatigue during treatment
- Hair loss in the treated area (often temporary)
- Late effects: rare but possible cognitive changes with large radiation volumes
- For SRS to tumor near sinus: risk of venous sinus stenosis (rare)

---

### Option D: Combination Approach (Most Likely Recommendation)

**For a 3.0 cm tentorial meningioma with venous sinus involvement, the most likely recommendation from a top center will be:**

**Surgical subtotal resection → followed by Gamma Knife / CyberKnife to residual**

OR

**Primary radiosurgery (SRS/fractionated) without surgery** (if she prefers to avoid craniotomy and tumor remains at or under 3 cm)

The choice depends on:
- Her neurological status (currently no deficits per MRI)
- Rate of growth (baseline MRI now; repeat in 3 months?)
- Her preferences (surgery vs. radiation risk profile)
- The center's expertise
- Whether the sinus is occluded or patent

---

### Option E: Drug Therapy / Chemotherapy (Limited Role in Grade I)

Chemotherapy has a **very limited role** in Grade I meningioma. It is generally reserved for:
- Recurrent meningioma after surgery and radiation
- Grade II/III meningiomas
- Tumors that have failed all other options

Drugs that have been studied with modest results:
- **Hydroxyurea** — cytotoxic agent, some disease stabilization but low response rates
- **Octreotide/Sandostatin** (somatostatin analog) — meningiomas express SSTR2; some trials show stabilization
- **Bevacizumab (Avastin)** — anti-angiogenic, studied in recurrent meningioma; modest results
- **Targeted therapy** (experimental): Vismodegib (SMO inhibitor), FAK inhibitors (for NF2-mutant), AKT inhibitors

**For her Grade I tumor, systemic drug therapy is NOT standard and would only be considered if surgery and radiation are not options or have failed.**

---

### The Hormone Connection — Anti-Progesterone Therapy

**Critical context:** Meningiomas are strongly associated with female hormones.

- Meningiomas occur **twice as often in women as men**
- ~65–70% of meningiomas express **progesterone receptors** (PR-positive)
- ~30–40% express **estrogen receptors**
- Tumors can grow during pregnancy (due to hormone surge) and stabilize after menopause
- Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are associated with increased meningioma risk

**Implication for the patient:** Any hormonal medications she takes should be disclosed to the neurosurgeon. If she is on HRT or oral contraceptives, stopping them is usually recommended.

**Anti-Progesterone Therapies Studied:**

**Mifepristone (RU-486):**
- Has been studied as meningioma treatment since the 1990s
- Mechanism: Blocks progesterone receptors on tumor cells
- Multiple clinical trials have been conducted
- Results: Modest — some tumor stabilization, occasional partial response; no consistent significant shrinkage in randomized trials
- Key trials: SWOG S9005 (randomized trial — showed no benefit in unselected patients, but PR-positive patients showed trend toward benefit)
- **Current status:** Not FDA-approved for meningioma; rarely used off-label
- Side effects: Fatigue, adrenal insufficiency with long use
- **Worth discussing** with oncologist if PR-positive on biopsy, for recurrent/residual disease

**Medroxyprogesterone — AVOID:** Some physicians have mistakenly given this thinking it helps; it's a progestin and may actually stimulate meningioma growth.

**Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRMs):** Under investigation.

**Tamoxifen (anti-estrogen):** Limited data; not standard.

## SECTION 4: SKULL BASE NEUROSURGERY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE

This **must be treated at a high-volume skull base surgery center.** The venous sinus involvement makes this a specialized case that should not be handled by a community neurosurgeon or general academic neurosurgeon without specific skull base and posterior fossa expertise.

1. **Call the patient coordination line directly** — state you have a newly diagnosed meningioma with venous sinus involvement and need a skull base neurosurgery consultation. Use the word "skull base."
2. **Many top centers have a Meningioma Program** — ask specifically for that team, not general neurosurgery
3. **Bring:** MRI films on CD/USB + MRI report + any other imaging
4. **Timeline:** Most major centers can see urgent meningioma patients within 1–3 weeks
5. **Telehealth consultations:** Many top centers now offer virtual second-opinion consultations — ask specifically

---

## SECTION 5: DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP — WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT

### Likely Next Steps After Initial Neurosurgery Consultation

1. **MRV (MR Venography)** — Critical for this patient. Maps venous flow, sinus patency, and collateral circulation. Will determine whether sinus can be safely approached.

2. **CT with/without contrast** — Shows bone involvement, helps with surgical planning

3. **DOTATATE PET/CT** — Newer imaging using radiolabeled somatostatin analog. Highly sensitive for meningioma. Shows full extent of tumor including portions that may not be visible on MRI. Increasingly standard at top centers.

4. **Cerebral Angiography (DSA)** — May be recommended to map arterial blood supply to tumor and assess sinus involvement in detail. Required if embolization is being considered.

5. **Pre-operative embolization** — A separate, minimally invasive procedure (through the groin artery) to block the tumor's blood supply before surgery, reducing surgical bleeding. Typically done 1–2 days before surgery.

6. **Neuropsychological testing** — Baseline cognitive assessment before any treatment

7. **Ophthalmology evaluation** — Baseline visual fields (posterior fossa/occipital lobe proximity)

8. **Audiological evaluation** — Baseline hearing (posterior fossa location)

---

## SECTION 6: QUESTIONS TO ASK AT THE NEUROSURGERY CONSULTATION

**About the tumor and diagnosis:**
1. Does this MRI appearance confirm a meningioma? How confident are you?
2. What grade do you think this is, based on imaging alone?
3. What are the molecular markers you would request from pathology?
4. Is this a tentorial meningioma with transverse-sigmoid sinus involvement — is that accurate?
5. Is the sinus patent? Has it been compromised at all?

**About treatment options:**
6. What are my wife's options — surgery, radiosurgery, or both?
7. What is your experience specifically with tentorial/posterior fossa meningiomas involving the venous sinuses?
8. How many of these cases do you do per year? (Target: 20+ per year for skull base)
9. If surgery: What is the realistic extent of resection (Simpson Grade)? Why?
10. If you cannot completely remove the tumor, what happens to the remaining portion?
11. What are the specific risks of surgery at this location — what deficits could she wake up with?
12. Is primary radiosurgery a reasonable alternative to surgery for this tumor, given its size?
13. Is proton therapy better than Gamma Knife for her specific location?

**About the sinus involvement:**
14. Will you order an MRV to better assess the sinus?
15. Is embolization planned? What are the risks of that procedure?
16. If you need to sacrifice the sinus — what happens? Can the brain compensate?
17. What happens if the sinus is only partially involved — do you leave that portion of tumor?

**About recovery:**
18. What is the typical recovery time for this approach?
19. What deficits, if any, should she expect temporarily or permanently?
20. What does headache relief look like post-treatment?

**About follow-up:**
21. How will we monitor for recurrence?
22. What would recurrence look like, and how would we treat it?

**About clinical trials:**
23. Are there any clinical trials she qualifies for?
24. Do you recommend any molecular or genetic testing beyond standard WHO grading?

**The "second opinion" question (say this directly):**
25. "We're planning to get a second opinion at [named center]. Is there any imaging or information we should bring?"

## SECTION 7: FENBENDAZOLE (FBZ) — WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS

### What Is Fenbendazole?

Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole antiparasitic drug used for decades in veterinary medicine (Panacur, Safe-Guard) to treat intestinal worms in dogs, cats, horses, and livestock. It is FDA-approved for animal use, NOT for human cancer treatment.

**Cost:** ~$10–15 per week for dog-dose equivalent. Widely available at farm supply stores and pet supply stores.

### Mechanism of Action (Why It Might Work Against Cancer)

Multiple laboratory mechanisms have been identified:

1. **Microtubule disruption:** Fenbendazole binds to tubulin (the protein that forms cellular "rails" called microtubules). Cancer cells depend heavily on microtubules for cell division. This is the same basic mechanism as taxane chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel) — though FBZ acts differently enough that cross-resistance is not guaranteed.

2. **Glucose transporter (GLUT) disruption:** FBZ has been shown in cell studies to inhibit GLUT transporters, cutting off glucose supply to cancer cells (which are glucose-dependent — the Warburg effect). This is why it pairs theoretically with a ketogenic diet.

3. **p53 pathway activation:** FBZ may reactivate p53 (the tumor suppressor gene), promoting apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.

4. **Mitochondrial dysfunction:** FBZ disrupts the electron transport chain in cancer cell mitochondria, reducing energy production.

5. **Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) inhibition:** Reduces the tumor's ability to create new blood vessels (anti-angiogenic effect).

### Published Research on Fenbendazole and Cancer

**Key publications (preclinical/cell line and animal studies):**

- **Dogra et al., 2018 (Scientific Reports):** Showed FBZ had potent anti-cancer activity in human xenograft tumors in mice. This study sparked enormous community interest. Found FBZ disrupted GLUT transporters and interfered with proteasomal function in cancer cells.

- **Lee et al., 2019 (Scientific Reports, South Korea):** A key paper — showed FBZ had significant anti-cancer effects in colorectal cancer cell lines and animal models. Also showed synergy with vitamin E succinate.

- **Multiple cell-line studies (2019–2024):** FBZ has shown activity against lung cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer cells. Studies are almost entirely **in vitro (cell culture) and animal models** — not human clinical trials.

**Evidence for brain/CNS tumors specifically:**
- **No published clinical trials** exist for FBZ in meningioma specifically
- A few cell-line studies suggest activity in glioblastoma (GBM) — not meningioma
- The PubMed search for "fenbendazole meningioma" returns zero oncology results
- Animal studies showing FBZ brain penetration are limited; blood-brain barrier penetration of FBZ is not well-characterized

**Evidence level rating for FBZ in meningioma:** ⭐ (1/5) — Preclinical only. No human data. No meningioma-specific data. Mechanism plausible but unproven for this specific tumor type.

### The Joe Tippens Case

Joe Tippens was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in 2016 and given 3 months to live. He went into complete remission. He attributed it to fenbendazole combined with specific supplements. His story spread globally, especially in South Korea, and prompted the Dogra 2018 Scientific Reports study.

**His complete protocol (from mycancerstory.rocks):**
- **Fenbendazole (Panacur C):** One packet (222 mg) per day, 3 days on / 4 days off cycle
- **Vitamin E Succinate (not regular vitamin E):** 400–800 mg/day (this specific form matters — succinate has known anti-cancer properties)
- **Bio-Enhanced Turmeric / Curcumin:** High-dose, bioavailable form (e.g., Theracurmin, or newer UltraCur)
- **CBD Oil:** Full-spectrum, high-quality
- **Berberine** (added later): 500–1500 mg/day
- **Quercetin:** Added to later protocol

**Important caveats about the Tippens case:**
1. He was simultaneously enrolled in an immunotherapy clinical trial (pembrolizumab). His remission may have been from the immunotherapy.
2. This is a single case report — not evidence of efficacy
3. He has since become associated with a supplements company (financial interest)
4. South Korea saw thousands of cancer patients adopt his protocol — oncologists there saw no observable population-level benefit

**Dosing used by the online cancer community (NOT FDA-endorsed):**
- **FBZ dose:** 222–444 mg daily, 3 days on / 4 days off cycle
- **Human equivalent:** Some protocols use 1 gram of FBZ daily (based on scaling from the Dogra mouse study)
- **Route:** Oral; best absorbed with fatty food
- **Duration:** Indefinite in community protocols

### Drug Interactions and Contraindications for Brain Tumor Patients

**Caution with:**
- **CYP enzyme interactions:** FBZ is metabolized by liver enzymes. It may interact with drugs metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4. Temozolomide, dexamethasone, and anti-seizure medications are metabolized by these pathways.
- **Warfarin/blood thinners:** FBZ may increase anticoagulant effect
- **Pre-operative use:** Should be STOPPED at least 2 weeks before surgery (any anti-angiogenic or anti-platelet effect)
- **During radiation:** Unknown interaction — some community protocols pause FBZ during active radiation treatment; limited data
- **Steroids (dexamethasone):** Commonly given for brain tumor edema; may interact with FBZ
- **Liver function:** FBZ is hepatotoxic at high doses in some patients; liver enzymes should be monitored

**Contraindications:**
- Pregnancy (category risk)
- Pre-existing liver disease
- Active anticoagulation therapy (relative)

**Overall safety profile:** At veterinary doses, FBZ is considered relatively safe for short-term use. Long-term safety in humans at cancer-protocol doses is unknown. Some reports of GI upset, elevated liver enzymes.

### Current Clinical Trials for Fenbendazole

As of February 2026:
- **No completed or active clinical trials** for fenbendazole in human cancer are registered on clinicaltrials.gov
- A proposed Phase I trial was discussed in South Korea but status is unclear
- Academic groups in the US have expressed interest but no formal registration

**Bottom line on FBZ for meningioma:** The theoretical basis is plausible but weak for meningioma specifically. Most FBZ research is in colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer — not meningioma. The community enthusiasm is high, but the evidence for meningioma is essentially zero. If she uses it as an adjunct, it would be reasonable to discuss with her oncologist and monitor liver enzymes. It should NOT replace or delay evidence-based treatment.

## SECTION 8: IVERMECTIN — WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS

### What Is Ivermectin?

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug used in humans for river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, and scabies. It is FDA-approved for human use at specific doses. It gained enormous attention during COVID-19 (where evidence was ultimately negative for most outcomes).

### Mechanism of Action as Potential Anti-Cancer Agent

Multiple mechanisms have been identified in laboratory studies:

1. **WNT/β-catenin pathway inhibition:** Blocks a key cancer growth signaling pathway
2. **P-glycoprotein inhibition:** May overcome multi-drug resistance in cancer cells
3. **Induction of mitochondrial apoptosis:** Programmed cancer cell death
4. **SIN3 domain targeting:** Unique mechanism targeting protein interaction domains in cancer cells
5. **PAK1 kinase inhibition:** Blocks cancer cell growth and migration

### Research on Brain Tumors — Glioblastoma and Meningioma

**For glioblastoma:**
- A 2021 review in *Cancer Medicine* identified ivermectin as showing preclinical activity in GBM cell lines
- Ivermectin crosses the blood-brain barrier to some extent — relevant for brain tumors
- Several papers show cytotoxicity in GBM stem cells in vitro

**For meningioma specifically:**
- **No published research exists** on ivermectin and meningioma
- Meningiomas are extra-axial (outside the brain), so blood-brain barrier penetration is less critical — the tumor has direct blood supply from dural vessels
- The signaling pathways ivermectin targets (WNT, PAK1) may be relevant in some meningiomas, but no meningioma-specific studies have been conducted

**Evidence level for ivermectin in meningioma:** ⭐ (1/5) — No meningioma data. General anti-cancer mechanisms identified in preclinical studies of other tumors.

### Human Clinical Trials for Ivermectin in Cancer

- A Phase II trial of ivermectin in breast cancer (NCT02366884) was conducted — showed some signal in biomarker studies
- No brain tumor trials are active as of February 2026
- A pilot study in cervical cancer showed some response

### Dosing in the Cancer Community (NOT FDA-endorsed)

Community protocols typically use:
- **0.4–0.6 mg/kg per day** (vs. 0.2 mg/kg for antiparasitic use) — 2–3× the antiparasitic dose
- Daily dosing vs. the single-dose antiparasitic approach
- Taken with a high-fat meal for better absorption

### Drug Interactions and Cautions

- **CNS effects:** Ivermectin at high doses can cause CNS toxicity (dizziness, confusion, sedation) — relevant for a brain tumor patient
- **P-glycoprotein substrates:** May interact with many drugs
- **Warfarin:** Increased anticoagulant effect
- **CYP3A4 drugs:** May interact with medications metabolized by CYP3A4
- **Pre-operative:** Discontinue before surgery
- **Dexamethasone:** Corticosteroids may increase ivermectin CNS penetration (possibly increasing toxicity)

**Bottom line on Ivermectin for meningioma:** Similar to FBZ — mechanistically plausible but no tumor-specific data. Can be discussed with her oncologist as an adjunct at appropriate doses. Should not replace evidence-based treatment.

### Berberine ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** Alkaloid compound found in goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape. Has been used in traditional medicine for millennia. Available OTC.

**Anti-cancer mechanisms:**
- Inhibits NF-κB signaling (reduces inflammation that drives cancer)
- Induces apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways
- Inhibits VEGF (anti-angiogenic)
- Inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion
- Activates AMPK pathway (similar to metformin)
- Inhibits cancer stem cells

**Evidence in meningioma:** No meningioma-specific studies. Several studies in glioblastoma cell lines show activity.

**General anti-cancer evidence:** Substantial preclinical evidence across multiple cancer types. A few small human studies in colorectal cancer and other GI tumors show promising signals.

**Dosing:** 500 mg 2–3× daily (1000–1500 mg/day). Better absorbed with meals. Bioavailability is poor — some products add bioperine (black pepper extract) or use berberine HCl.

**Drug interactions:** Inhibits CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2C9. May interact with warfarin, statins, metformin, anti-seizure drugs. Check with physician.

**Side effects:** GI upset at high doses; constipation or diarrhea. Mild hypoglycemia possible.

**Bottom line:** Reasonable adjunct. Joe Tippens includes it in his protocol. Anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects may be broadly beneficial. LOW risk profile.

---

### Vitamin D3 (High-Dose) ⭐⭐⭐

**Meningioma-specific connection:**
- **Very strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and meningioma risk** — multiple epidemiological studies
- Vitamin D receptors are expressed on meningioma cells
- Laboratory studies show calcitriol (active vitamin D) inhibits meningioma cell proliferation in vitro
- Low vitamin D levels are associated with more aggressive meningioma behavior

**Evidence:** Several observational studies link low vitamin D to meningioma incidence. No interventional trials in meningioma patients have been completed.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Test serum 25-OH vitamin D level immediately** — this is the first thing to do
2. Target: 60–80 ng/mL (higher than the 30–50 ng/mL most labs call "normal")
3. Standard supplementation: 2000–5000 IU/day to achieve this range
4. High-dose (10,000–20,000 IU/day) requires medical supervision and monitoring of calcium levels
5. Take with K2 (MK-7 form) to direct calcium to bones rather than soft tissue (100–200 mcg K2 per 5000 IU D3)

**Safety:** At maintenance doses (5,000 IU/day), very safe. Hypercalcemia possible at very high doses — monitor calcium and vitamin D levels every 3 months.

**Bottom line:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY. Test her vitamin D level now. Very likely deficient. Strong mechanistic and epidemiological rationale. Low cost, low risk, easy to implement.

---

### Vitamin C (High-Dose IV) ⭐⭐⭐

**Mechanism:** At intravenous high doses (25–100+ g), vitamin C generates hydrogen peroxide selectively in cancer cells (via pro-oxidant mechanism). Cancer cells have low catalase levels and cannot neutralize this — it kills them. Normal cells are protected by adequate catalase.

**Evidence:**
- Phase I/II trials at NIH and University of Kansas showed IV vitamin C is safe at doses up to 100 g
- Several studies show synergy with chemotherapy and radiation — may reduce side effects while enhancing efficacy
- Observational studies in cancer patients show improved quality of life, reduced fatigue, reduced chemo side effects
- Limited tumor-shrinkage data; primarily used as adjunct to standard treatment
- A 2021 study showed IV vitamin C synergized with checkpoint inhibitors

**Meningioma-specific data:** None. General anti-cancer and immune-supporting mechanisms apply.

**Protocol:** Typically 25–75 g IV, 2–3× per week. Requires IV infusion at an integrative medicine clinic or naturopathic oncologist.

**Prerequisites:** Must check G6PD enzyme status — rare genetic deficiency makes high-dose IV vitamin C dangerous.

**Oral vitamin C:** At high oral doses (>1g), bowel tolerance limits absorption. Liposomal vitamin C achieves higher blood levels than regular oral vitamin C.

**Cost:** $75–200 per IV session. Health insurance rarely covers it.

**Bottom line:** Reasonable adjunct during radiation treatment. Strong safety profile when properly screened. Find an integrative oncologist or naturopathic oncologist who works alongside her conventional team.

---

### Curcumin / Turmeric ⭐⭐⭐

**Mechanism:** Multiple anti-cancer pathways:
- NF-κB inhibition (major anti-inflammatory)
- Inhibits STAT3, VEGF, Bcl-2, Notch
- Promotes apoptosis
- Anti-angiogenic
- May sensitize cancer cells to radiation

**Evidence:** Enormous preclinical literature. Human trials limited by poor bioavailability of standard curcumin. High-dose standard curcumin has essentially no bioavailability — it needs bioenhancement.

**Meningioma-specific data:** Limited. One study showed curcumin inhibited meningioma cell growth in vitro.

**Bioavailability problem and solutions:**
- Standard curcumin: <1% oral bioavailability
- **Theracurmin:** Colloidal dispersion form — 27× more bioavailable
- **Meriva (phosphatidylcholine complex):** Well-studied, 29× more bioavailable
- **Longvida (SLCP):** Designed to cross blood-brain barrier — potentially most relevant for brain tumors
- **UltraCur/UltraCurcumin (Joe Tippens' current rec):** Claims 6× over Theracurmin
- **Bioperine (piperine):** Black pepper extract increases curcumin absorption 20×

**Dose:** 1000–4000 mg/day of bioavailable form

**Drug interactions:** May inhibit CYP3A4 — potential interaction with many medications. May have mild anti-platelet effect — pause before surgery.

**Bottom line:** Anti-inflammatory benefits are real. Use a bioavailable form only — standard turmeric/curcumin powder is essentially ineffective. Longvida form preferred for brain tumor applications.

---

### Melatonin (High-Dose, Lissoni Protocol) ⭐⭐⭐

**Why it's interesting for meningioma:**
- Melatonin has direct anti-proliferative effects on meningioma cells — several studies show it inhibits meningioma growth in vitro
- Anti-angiogenic effects
- Immune-modulating effects (stimulates NK cells, IL-2)
- Radiosensitizer — may make tumors more responsive to radiation
- Anti-oxidant that protects normal cells during radiation while sensitizing cancer cells

**Lissoni Protocol (Dr. Paolo Lissoni, Italian oncologist):**
- Used melatonin 20 mg nightly in multiple cancer clinical trials
- Multiple randomized trials showed improved survival and quality of life in lung, breast, colon cancer alongside chemotherapy
- Published in mainstream oncology journals (Oncology, British Journal of Cancer)
- This is one of the more studied alternative protocols

**Dose:** Standard sleep: 0.5–5 mg. Anti-cancer doses used: 20–40 mg nightly. Standard-release form is preferable for sleep; extended-release for overnight tumor suppression.

**Safety:** Melatonin at 20 mg is very safe. Drowsiness is expected. May interact with anticoagulants, immunosuppressants.

**Bottom line:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY for consideration. Meningioma-specific in vitro data exists. The Lissoni protocol is the most scientifically credible of the alternative oncology approaches. Very safe at 20 mg. Consider starting 20 mg melatonin nightly now.

---

### Metformin (Off-Label) ⭐⭐⭐

**What it is:** Common diabetes drug (biguanide class); available by prescription.

**Anti-cancer mechanisms:**
- Activates AMPK (energy sensing pathway) → inhibits mTOR (cancer growth signaling)
- Reduces insulin and IGF-1 levels (both are cancer growth factors)
- Inhibits mitochondrial Complex I in cancer cells (reduces energy available to cancer)
- Reduces cancer stem cell populations

**Evidence:**
- Large epidemiological studies consistently show diabetic patients on metformin have lower cancer incidence and mortality
- Some studies show meningioma patients on metformin have better outcomes
- A 2020 study showed metformin inhibited meningioma cell proliferation in vitro
- Several cancer clinical trials underway

**Dosing (off-label cancer use):** 500–2000 mg/day (standard diabetes doses)

**Requires prescription.** Most integrative oncologists are willing to prescribe off-label. Some primary care physicians will too, given the safety profile.

**Safety:** Extremely well-characterized safety profile over 60+ years. Lactic acidosis risk is very rare. Avoid with significant kidney disease.

**Bottom line:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY for discussion with physician. Can be prescribed off-label. Known safety profile. Some meningioma-specific data. Relatively easy to obtain.

---

### Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) ⭐⭐

**What it is:** Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist normally used at 50 mg for addiction. At 1.5–4.5 mg (low dose), it has completely different, immunomodulatory effects.

**Mechanism at low dose:**
- Briefly blocks opioid receptors for a few hours → body compensates by upregulating endogenous opioid (endorphin) production
- Increased endorphins → enhanced immune function, especially NK cell activity
- Reduces neuroinflammation via glial cell modulation
- Potential anti-proliferative effects on some cancer cells

**Evidence:** Largely anecdotal and small case series. Some small trials in multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease. For cancer specifically:
- A few case reports of tumor stabilization
- The LDN Research Trust has collected hundreds of patient testimonials (not evidence, but signal)
- No randomized trials specifically in brain tumors

**Meningioma-specific data:** None published.

**Dosing:** 1.5–4.5 mg nightly (start low, titrate up). Must be compounded — not commercially available at these doses. Prescription required.

**Key caution:** CANNOT be used with opioid pain medications — will precipitate withdrawal. This is important for the post-surgical/post-treatment period.

**Cost:** $30–60/month at a compounding pharmacy.

**Bottom line:** Reasonable consideration after treatment, during recovery and surveillance. Low risk, modest potential benefit. Discuss with integrative oncologist.

---

### Ketogenic Diet ⭐⭐⭐

**The science (Warburg Effect):**
- Cancer cells predominantly use glucose for energy (even in the presence of oxygen — aerobic glycolysis)
- They cannot efficiently use ketones (fat-derived fuel)
- A ketogenic diet (very low carb, high fat) starves cancer cells of glucose while normal cells adapt to using ketones

**Evidence for brain tumors:**
- Several small clinical trials in glioblastoma show ketogenic diet is safe during standard treatment and may improve outcomes
- The Keto diet combined with the ketone supplement beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may have synergistic effects
- Reduces insulin/IGF-1 → reduces cancer growth signaling
- Brain tumors specifically studied: the brain can run on ketones; tumors cannot efficiently

**Meningioma-specific data:** No specific trials. Mechanistic rationale applies.

**Practical approach:**
- Classic ketogenic diet: <20–30g net carbs/day, ~70% calories from fat
- Aim for blood ketones 0.5–3.0 mmol/L (measurable with a blood ketone meter)
- Modified Atkins diet (less strict) may be more sustainable
- Work with a registered dietitian experienced in ketogenic diets for cancer

**Cautions:**
- Not appropriate immediately post-surgery (need caloric support for healing)
- May interact with certain medications
- Social/psychological burden of strict diet — quality of life consideration
- Not appropriate if on high-dose corticosteroids (alters metabolism)

**Bottom line:** Strong mechanistic rationale. Consistent with other anti-cancer dietary approaches. Recommend consulting a registered dietitian at her treatment center — many major centers now have keto-for-cancer programs.

---

### Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) ⭐⭐

**Mechanism:**
- Breathing 100% oxygen at 1.5–3 atmospheres of pressure
- Drives oxygen into tissues at much higher levels than normal breathing
- **Enhances radiation efficacy:** Oxygen is required for radiation to create DNA-damaging free radicals in cancer cells; hypoxic tumors are radiation-resistant
- Stimulates stem cell release for repair
- Anti-inflammatory effects on surrounding brain tissue
- May accelerate wound healing after surgery

**Evidence:**
- Studies show HBOT before and during radiation can improve tumor control in hypoxic solid tumors
- Several glioblastoma studies show potential benefit alongside temozolomide and radiation
- Post-radiation HBOT: established treatment for radiation necrosis (brain tissue death from radiation)

**Meningioma-specific data:** No specific studies. Potential value as radiation sensitizer and post-radiation recovery tool.

**Protocol if used alongside radiation:**
- Typical: 20–40 sessions of 60–90 minutes at 2.0–2.4 ATA (atmospheres) before or alongside radiation
- Requires a hyperbaric oxygen facility (hospital-based or free-standing center)

**Cautions:**
- Ear barotrauma (pressure equalization issue)
- Rare: oxygen toxicity at high doses
- Contraindicated if on certain chemotherapy drugs (some drugs are radiosensitized by oxygen, increasing toxicity to normal tissue)
- **Theoretical concern:** Theoretical risk of stimulating tumor angiogenesis (largely theoretical, not confirmed in practice)

**Cost:** $100–300 per session; typically not covered by insurance unless for wound healing or radiation necrosis

**Bottom line:** Reasonable consideration alongside radiation therapy. Discuss with radiation oncologist — some are supportive, others skeptical. Strongest evidence as post-radiation necrosis treatment.

---

### Vitamin E Succinate ⭐⭐

**Why it's different from regular Vitamin E:**
- Alpha-tocopherol succinate (Vitamin E succinate) has demonstrated anti-cancer properties that regular Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) does NOT have
- The succinate ester form specifically induces apoptosis in cancer cells
- Shown to enhance FBZ effects in the Lee 2019 study
- Anti-proliferative effects in several cancer cell lines

**Evidence:** Preclinical only. No human cancer trials specifically using Vitamin E succinate.

**Dose in community protocols:** 400–800 mg/day

**Safety:** Generally safe. Regular Vitamin E at very high doses (>2000 IU/day) may increase bleeding risk — relevant pre-surgery.

## SECTION 10: EMERGING TREATMENTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS

### Targeted Molecular Therapies

Recent molecular profiling has identified actionable mutations in some meningiomas:

- **AKT1 mutation (E17K):** Found in ~10% of meningiomas. AKT inhibitors (capivasertib) being tested in clinical trials.
- **SMO mutation:** Found in ~5% of meningiomas. Vismodegib (hedgehog pathway inhibitor) has been tested.
- **NF2 mutation:** Found in ~50% of meningiomas. FAK inhibitors (defactinib) being studied.
- **TRAF7, KLF4, PIK3CA mutations:** Various other targetable alterations identified

**Clinical trial resource:** Search clinicaltrials.gov for "meningioma" — filter by "Recruiting" status. Look for:
- Trials specifically for Grade I meningioma with residual disease
- Molecular/targeted therapy trials (you need molecular profiling first)
- Radiosurgery trials with novel combinations

### Immunotherapy / Checkpoint Inhibitors

**Current evidence in meningioma:** Limited. A Phase II trial of nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) for rare CNS cancers including meningioma (NCI-CONNECT) is ongoing. Preliminary data are modest. Checkpoint inhibitors are not standard of care for Grade I meningioma.

### Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)

- **Lu-177 DOTATATE (Lutathera)** — FDA approved for neuroendocrine tumors
- Meningiomas express SSTR2 receptor → potential target for PRRT
- Several case series show partial responses and disease stabilization in recurrent meningioma
- Being studied in clinical trials specifically for recurrent/progressive meningioma
- Currently not standard of care for Grade I, but worth knowing about for recurrence

4. **Major centers run their own investigator-initiated trials** not listed on clinicaltrials.gov — ask specifically

---

## SECTION 12: THE MICROANGIOPATHIC ISCHEMIC CHANGES — SEPARATE NOTE

The MRI also shows "moderate chronic microangiopathic ischemic changes." This is a **separate finding from the meningioma** and represents small vessel disease — tiny blood vessels in the brain have been damaged, likely from years of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, age, or other cardiovascular risk factors.

**This is common in adults at age 60.** It does not indicate a second tumor or metastatic disease.

**Why it matters for treatment planning:**
1. **Surgery:** Higher baseline risk for perioperative stroke or cognitive changes
2. **Radiation:** Small vessel disease may make brain tissue slightly more vulnerable to radiation effects
3. **Medications:** Anticoagulants and blood pressure medications should be optimized
4. **Independent management:** These changes should be followed by a neurologist or her primary care physician with:
   - Blood pressure optimization (target <130/80)
   - Cholesterol management (statin if indicated)
   - Diabetes control if present
   - Aspirin (discuss with neurosurgeon — may be paused before surgery)
