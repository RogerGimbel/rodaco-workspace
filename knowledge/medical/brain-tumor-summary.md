# Meningioma Quick-Reference Summary
**For Roger Gimbel | Compiled February 19, 2026**

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE IN PLAIN ENGLISH

Your wife almost certainly has a **benign (Grade I) meningioma** — the most common type of brain tumor, and in most cases a very manageable one. The MRI characteristics (homogeneous enhancement, extra-axial, no edema, no mass effect) are textbook Grade I. The hard news is its **location** — the left tentorial leaflet with extension toward the transverse-sigmoid venous sinus junction. This is a skull base location that requires a specialist, not a general neurosurgeon.

**The good news:** Most people with Grade I meningiomas live long, normal lives after treatment. This is not a GBM diagnosis. 10-year survival rates exceed 90%.

**The hard part:** Sinus involvement makes surgery more complex and may mean intentional partial resection followed by radiosurgery — a completely valid and commonly used strategy.

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY

### 🚨 URGENT PRIORITIES (this week)

1. **Get a skull base neurosurgeon consultation — NOT a general neurosurgeon**
   - Call one of these centers and say: "Tentorial meningioma with venous sinus involvement, need skull base specialist"
   - 📍 Barrow Neurological Institute: (602) 406-3000
   - 📍 Mayo Clinic: (507) 284-2111
   - 📍 UCSF: (415) 353-2966
   - 📍 Mass General (Harvard): (617) 726-2000
   - 📍 Johns Hopkins: (410) 955-5000

2. **Join Meningioma Mommas Facebook group NOW**
   - meningiomamommas.org → Support → Facebook Group
   - Thousands of patients with this exact diagnosis. Invaluable.

3. **Get MRI images on USB/CD** — not just the report. Bring images to every consultation.

4. **Schedule minimum 2 specialist consultations at major centers** — for comparison

### ✅ LOW-RISK THINGS SHE CAN START DOING NOW (while waiting for appointments)

- **Vitamin D3:** Test serum level first (ask PCP). Start 5,000 IU/day + K2 100 mcg (strong meningioma connection)
- **Melatonin:** 20 mg nightly (Lissoni protocol — in vitro meningioma data, very safe)
- **Stop any hormonal medications** (OCP, HRT) — meningiomas have progesterone receptors; discuss with prescribing doctor
- **Mediterranean or anti-inflammatory diet** — reduce processed carbs, increase omega-3s
- **Optimize blood pressure** — especially given the small vessel disease finding

## THE TREATMENT OPTIONS SHE'LL BE OFFERED

### Option 1: Surgery (Craniotomy)
- Requires opening the skull (posterior fossa approach)
- Goal: Remove as much tumor as safely possible without damaging the venous sinus
- Complete removal (Simpson I) may NOT be possible due to sinus involvement
- Planned partial resection + radiosurgery to residual is a VALID strategy
- **Requires a skull base neurosurgeon** — ask how many of these they do per year (aim for 20+/year)
- Recovery: 3–7 days hospital, 4–8 weeks at home

### Option 2: Radiosurgery Without Surgery
- Gamma Knife: Best at <3 cm; 91–97% local control at 5 years
- CyberKnife (fractionated): 3–5 sessions; good option at 3 cm
- Proton Beam Therapy: 25–30 sessions; lowest radiation scatter; good for sinus-adjacent tumor
- No incisions, outpatient, shorter recovery
- She is at the upper boundary for single-session Gamma Knife (3.0 cm) — fractionated approaches well-suited

### Option 3: Combination (Most Likely at Major Center)
- Surgical subtotal resection → Gamma Knife/CyberKnife to residual
- Best of both: debulking reduces mass, radiation controls residual with precision
- Very commonly used strategy for sinus-involving posterior fossa meningiomas

### Option 4: Active Surveillance (Probably NOT right for her)
- She has symptoms (headaches) and the tumor is 3.0 cm
- Most neurosurgeons would recommend treatment at this size with symptoms
- May be offered as a temporary option while pursuing second opinions

## THE VENOUS SINUS PROBLEM — EXPLAINED SIMPLY

The transverse and sigmoid sinuses are large venous channels that drain blood from the brain toward the heart. Her tumor is touching/involving these channels. 

- **If sinus is patent (open):** Surgeons must be very careful — damaging it could be catastrophic
- **If sinus is occluded (blocked by tumor):** Can be resected more aggressively
- **MRV (MR Venography) is needed** to map this — ask for it if not ordered

This is WHY this must be treated at a skull base center, not a local hospital.

---

## IMAGING LIKELY TO BE RECOMMENDED

| Test | Why |
|------|-----|
| MRV (MR Venography) | Maps venous sinus anatomy and blood flow — CRITICAL |
| CT scan | Bone involvement, surgical planning |
| DOTATATE PET | Highly sensitive for meningioma; maps extent of disease |
| Cerebral angiography | If embolization planned before surgery |
| Functional MRI | Maps eloquent cortex near tumor |

## QUESTIONS TO BRING TO EVERY APPOINTMENT

1. How many posterior fossa / tentorial meningiomas with sinus involvement do you treat per year?
2. What Simpson grade resection do you think is realistic for this tumor?
3. Is primary radiosurgery (without surgery) a reasonable option given the sinus involvement?
4. Will you order an MRV to better characterize the sinus involvement?
5. Is embolization being considered before surgery?
6. What specific deficits could she wake up with from surgery at this location?
7. What is your experience with proton therapy vs. Gamma Knife for this exact location?
8. Are there any clinical trials she qualifies for?
9. Would you recommend molecular profiling of the tumor pathology?

## ADJUNCT THERAPIES — PRIORITY LIST

These are complements to, NOT replacements for, conventional treatment:

| Therapy | Evidence | Priority | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Vitamin D3 + K2 | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🔴 HIGH | Test serum level first. Strong meningioma connection. 5,000 IU/day min. |
| Melatonin 20 mg | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🔴 HIGH | Nightly. In vitro meningioma data. Very safe. |
| Stop HRT/OCP | Clinical | 🔴 HIGH | Meningiomas are progesterone-sensitive |
| Curcumin (bioavailable) | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🟡 MEDIUM | Longvida or Theracurmin form only. 1–4g/day. |
| Berberine | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🟡 MEDIUM | 500 mg 2–3×/day. Anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer. |
| Metformin (Rx) | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🟡 MEDIUM | Discuss with physician. Off-label but well-studied. |
| Anti-inflammatory diet | ⭐⭐⭐ | 🟡 MEDIUM | Ketogenic or Mediterranean. Practical sustainability key. |
| IV Vitamin C | ⭐⭐ | 🟡 MEDIUM | 25–75g IV, 2–3×/week. Check G6PD first. Find integrative oncologist. |
| Fenbendazole | ⭐ | 🟢 LOW | No meningioma-specific data. Discuss with physician if interested. Monitor liver. |
| Ivermectin | ⭐ | 🟢 LOW | No meningioma-specific data. More evidence needed. Discuss with physician. |
| LDN (Low-Dose Naltrexone) | ⭐⭐ | 🟢 LOW | Consider AFTER treatment. Rx required. Cannot combine with opioids. |
| HBOT | ⭐⭐ | 🟢 LOW | Best evidence alongside radiation. Discuss with rad oncologist. |

## PROGNOSIS — THE HONEST PICTURE

**If Grade I (very likely based on MRI):**
- 5-year survival: 87–97%
- 10-year survival: >90%
- Recurrence after complete resection: 10–20% over 10 years
- Recurrence after radiosurgery: ~5–15% at 5 years
- Life expectancy: Not significantly shortened from this tumor
- Quality of life: Can be excellent — many patients return to full activity

**The "skull base" complication** mainly affects surgical complexity and the risk of specific neurological deficits — it does NOT change the Grade I prognosis. This tumor is still highly manageable with appropriate expertise.
