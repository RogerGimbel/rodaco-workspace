## Raw Transcript
> Why don't you use your agent browser to browse https://knife-collector-28gfhftcmc.replit.app/. This is my original app for a knife collection that I developed on BladeKeeper. It's not multi-tenant, and there's no sign-in; there is a back-end to it, but it's just available on the open web. It was made for my daughter to give her information about my knife collection because she loves it. This is where it lives on the internet, and it was developed in Replit.

## Extracted Ideas
- BladeKeeper original version lives at: https://knife-collector-28gfhftcmc.replit.app/

- Purpose: catalog and share info about Roger's knife collection with his daughter
- Currently failing to load (Replit app sleeping / stale backend connection)
- Color scheme: amber/brown-orange accents on light gray background
