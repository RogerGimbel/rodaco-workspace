**Context:** Roger cataloging his full project portfolio and thinking about what to do with everything in the agentic AI era

## Raw Transcript
> I also have lots of projects in Lovable that I've developed and Replit:
> 1. BladeKeeper — An edge weapons collectors' web app.
> 2. Physiopal — A website designed months ago, before the current capabilities of AI coding, meant to help my father with his physiotherapy routines. It instructs and reminds him in a subtly nagging way, which could be useful for anyone elderly, especially those in physiotherapy or post-surgery.
> 3. Supplement Tracker — Designed for people on a carnivore diet who need to monitor electrolytes, calcium, B vitamins, and D vitamins. It's a very simple site with no backend; it uses local storage with import and export capabilities in case you switch devices.
>
> I have a selfgrowth.app website that's meant to be useful for people interested in self-improvement and self-help stuff. It was originally designed to replace selfgrowth.com. The owner of that site contracted me to help him with that, but it became a little too complex. Also, that niche is so saturated that nagging apps for self-help didn't seem to be that productive. We wanted to go in the direction of a content aggregator for famous self-help gurus (like Tony Robbins) where they could post their upcoming self-help events where they charge people to attend through Ticketmaster or Meetup to interface with them. It just seemed to me to be a dead end because the industry was so saturated, but there might be opportunities there, especially now in the age of agentic AI, to leverage that existing site and improve it.
>
> These are all sites that are in my GitHub repository (all the code), so we could: 1. Clone them to a local repo 2. Work on them 3. Push them back to Lovable. This follows our current development patterns, which is a great advantage based on where I was six months ago.
>
> I also have a domain, rodaco.ai, which was designed as a chatbot with long-term memory and semantic vector search (similar to the stuff we're doing right now). It's basically outdated, but the domain exists. I'd like to brainstorm ideas to change it around to be more up-to-date and sort of abandon the idea of an AI chatbot. Since the domain rodaco.ai exists, I think it could be leveraged because it is a valuable domain for what we're doing with Rodaco, the company. Both rodaco.co and rodaco.ai exist as domains that I own.
>
> As you can see, I have a lot on my plate. I've been very busy and doing a lot of stuff, but remember the context: we're now in a new age of agentic capabilities. I started many of these projects almost a year ago, and they exist in various states of completion. BeerPair is the only one that is completely finished for B2C. It's a consumer software-as-a-service app. While it might be a little outdated, it's a very complete AI wrapper that includes: 1. Bookmarking and favoriting 2. Viewing last scans and regenerating scans 3. Getting 12 food pairings using point-and-pair capability. That point-and-pair capability is a nice moat for competition against current chatbots. While you can probably do some of this in a chatbot now, you can't easily handle: (a) Favorites, bookmarks, and sharing (b) "Find near me" features (c) 12 pairings based on three different strategies: complement, contrast, and balance (d) Regenerating for non-alcoholic and craft beer (e) "Surprise me" and exotic gems. It's all valuable stuff, even if it's somewhat outdated. So, those are my brainstorming ideas.

## Extracted Ideas

### Project Inventory (GitHub/Lovable/Replit)

| Project | Status | Stack | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| **BeerPair** | ✅ Complete (B2C SaaS) | Lovable | Only fully finished product. Strong moat features. |
| **BladeKeeper** | Partial | Lovable | Edge weapons collectors' app. Niche but passionate audience. |
| **PhysioPal** | Partial | Lovable | Physio routines for elderly/post-surgery. Built for Roger's father. Subtle nagging reminders. |
| **Supplement Tracker** | Partial | Lovable | Carnivore diet electrolyte/vitamin tracking. No backend, local storage + import/export. |
| **SelfGrowth.app** | Stalled | ? | Originally a selfgrowth.com replacement. Client project. Content aggregator for self-help events (Tony Robbins etc → Ticketmaster/Meetup). Deemed dead end due to saturation. |
| **rodaco.ai** | Outdated | ? | Was an AI chatbot with long-term memory + vector search. Concept now obsolete but domain is valuable. |

### Domain Portfolio
- **rodaco.co** — corporate site (LIVE)
- **rodaco.ai** — available for repurposing. Valuable .ai domain.
- **beerpair.com** — product site (LIVE)
- **selfgrowth.app** — stalled but domain exists

### BeerPair's Competitive Moat
Roger's analysis of what makes BeerPair defensible vs chatbots:
1. Favorites, bookmarks, sharing — persistent UX chatbots lack
2. "Find near me" — location-aware, not just text
3. 12 pairings via 3 strategies: complement, contrast, balance
4. Non-alcoholic & craft beer regeneration
5. "Surprise me" and exotic gems
6. Point-and-pair (camera → food → pairings) — the core UX moat

### Strategic Observations
- All code is in GitHub → can clone, improve locally, push back to Lovable (current dev pattern works)
- Projects started ~1 year ago in various states — agentic AI changes what's possible with each
- PhysioPal has real humanitarian value — elderly care + post-surgery is underserved and growing
- Supplement Tracker is simple enough to finish quickly — carnivore/keto is a dedicated niche
- BladeKeeper is niche but collectors spend money
- selfgrowth.app might have new life with agentic AI (AI-powered event discovery, personalized self-help paths?)
- rodaco.ai needs a new purpose — what does Rodaco the AI company want to showcase there?

### rodaco.ai Repurposing Ideas (to explore later)
- Portfolio/showcase of Rodaco's AI products (BeerPair, future apps)
- AI capabilities demo — show what Rodaco can build
- Developer/agency landing page targeting B2B clients
- "AI lab" — experimental tools and demos
- Redirect to rodaco.co and consolidate?

### The Meta-Insight
Roger has 6+ products at various stages. The bottleneck isn't ideas or even code — it's finishing, polishing, and shipping. With agentic capabilities (overnight builds, automated testing, content generation), the calculus has changed. Projects that were too much work to finish 6 months ago might now be a few overnight builds away from launch.
