## Raw Transcript
> I've always been a futurist, ever since my 20s. Back in the day, I was creating apps on Hewlett-Packard handheld calculators for an ophthalmologist and using dBASE III for analyzing patient data and printing reports. I've always been on the bleeding edge of everything. I got cancer in 2010, which is why there might be a huge gap in my history between 2010 and 2024. I had stage 4 adrenocortical cancer, and that took me out of the ballgame for quite a while. But I'm back now, and I'm back to my excitement for futuristic stuff. I'm always looking for the latest and greatest, so if you could help me research—especially using X (formerly Twitter) search—that would be great. I find most of the information on X; it's even better than Google Search. Anybody who's anybody in a developer, CEO, or CTO role at the major companies is always posting there. It's incumbent on me to keep up, so if we could develop a plan to stay current based on that, I'd appreciate it. That's just something more to know about me. My cancer was a major deal, by the way: adrenocortical cancer. Look it up. Not many people survive it, but I did.

## Extracted Ideas

### Roger's Background
- Lifelong futurist — bleeding edge since his 20s
- Early career: built apps on HP handheld calculators for an ophthalmologist
- Used dBASE III for patient data analysis and report printing
- Has always been drawn to the latest technology

### Health History
- Stage 4 adrenocortical cancer diagnosed ~2010
- Adrenocortical carcinoma — extremely rare, aggressive cancer of the adrenal cortex. ~1-2 per million incidence. 5-year survival for stage 4 is roughly 10-15%. Roger is a survivor of one of the most lethal cancers.
- Gap in professional/tech activity roughly 2010-2024 (~14 years)
- Now fully back and re-engaged with technology, more driven than ever

### Research & Staying Current
- Roger considers X (Twitter) his #1 source for cutting-edge tech info — better than Google
- Key voices: developers, CEOs, CTOs at major AI/tech companies post there first
- Wants a systematic plan to stay current via X search and monitoring
- This aligns with existing capabilities: bird CLI for X search, Grok's built-in X search, Octolens for monitoring

### Actionable: Build a "Stay Current" System
- Curate a list of key voices to follow (AI leaders, framework creators, startup founders)
- Regular X searches for trending topics in AI, agentic frameworks, coding tools
- Could be a heartbeat task or cron job: "What's new in AI/dev this week?"
- Weekly digest of key developments, delivered via Telegram
- Use Octolens for broader mention tracking across platforms

- Builds on: Roger's preference for X as primary info source (MEMORY.md)
- Action potential: Weekly AI/tech digest cron job via X search
- Action potential: Curate "Roger's Watch List" of X accounts to monitor
