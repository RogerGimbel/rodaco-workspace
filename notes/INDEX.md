# Notes Index

*Roger's brainstorms, ideas, and thinking-out-loud — captured and organized.*

**Last synthesized:** 2026-02-19 (8 notes from 2026-02-18)

## By Theme

### 🚀 Product Ideas
- BeerPair demo video — live app usage capture showing food upload → pairing flow
- PhysioPal — elderly/post-surgery physio reminder app (built for Roger's father, broader potential)
- Supplement Tracker — carnivore diet electrolyte/vitamin tracking (simple, near-complete)
- BladeKeeper — edge weapons collectors' app (niche, passionate audience)

### 💼 Business & Strategy
- rodaco.ai domain repurposing — abandon chatbot concept, leverage valuable .ai domain
- selfgrowth.app — stalled client project, might have new life with agentic AI
- BeerPair competitive moat — point-and-pair, favorites, find-near-me, 3 pairing strategies
- Portfolio finishing strategy — 6+ projects at various stages, agentic AI changes effort calculus

### 🎯 Marketing & Growth
*(none yet)*

### 🤖 AI & Technology
- BladeKeeper "snap & identify" vision — photo → AI auto-populates all weapon attributes (Grok 4.1 vision)
- "Ask Grok" feature already exists in Replit BladeKeeper (Grok 2/3 era, upgrade-ready)
- supabase-workflow gap: UI-only clone→push pattern proven, backend (Edge Functions, migrations, RLS) workflow not yet established
- rodaco.ai domain ripe for repurposing — AI chatbot concept obsolete, valuable domain for showcasing Rodaco's AI products

### 🏗️ Infrastructure & Ops
- rogergimbel.dev: hamburger menu broke nav bar + blank block below it
- rodaco.co: whale hero colors still washed — need more vibrant ocean/sky
- Supabase workflow gap: clone → modify UI → push to GitHub is proven; Edge Functions + DB migrations + RLS changes still need a documented local dev pattern

### 💡 Personal / Misc
- Roger: lifelong futurist, early career in HP calculator apps + dBASE III for ophthalmology
- Stage 4 adrenocortical cancer survivor (2010) — ~14 year gap in tech, now back stronger
- X (Twitter) is his #1 research source — wants systematic "stay current" plan
- BladeKeeper is sentimental (built for his daughter) AND has real market (20 European collectors signed up on first launch)
- BeerPair with current AI tooling: 6 months solo → 3 days with agentic AI (Roger's own estimate)
- SparkFitness repo: reference material only, not a product — useful only for PhysioPal ideas

## Synthesis Log
*When I review notes and extract insights, I log it here.*

### 2026-02-19 (4 AM ET) — First Synthesis
Reviewed 8 notes from 2026-02-18. All were from a single long brainstorm session with Roger. Key durable insights:

**Product priorities (Roger's stated order):**
1. BladeKeeper My Blades UI (pet project + proven 20-sign-up demand from European collectors)
2. rogergimbel.dev hamburger menu / blank block bug fix
3. rodaco.co whale colors + BeerPair demo content (real screenshots/video)
4. PhysioPal (back burner)
5. rodaco.ai repurposing (future)

**New product insights extracted → bladekeeper/summary.md already updated:**
- Snap & Identify feature is the core vision
- 20 European collectors signed up on first launch = proven market
- BladeKeeper is personal (daughter) AND commercial

**Roger's Supabase concern:** UI workflow proven, backend workflow (Edge Functions, migrations, RLS) still undocumented. A reference doc would help him feel confident about deep modifications.

**Roger's domain portfolio:**
- rodaco.co (live), rodaco.ai (to repurpose), beerpair.com (live), selfgrowth.app (stalled)

**Insight: agentic leverage:** Roger estimates BeerPair (6 months solo) could be done in 3 days with current AI tooling. His portfolio of stalled/partial projects is now a queue of near-term completions, not a graveyard.

**Personas to enrich:**
- PhysioPal: elderly/post-surgery physio reminders → real humanitarian angle, father was the inspiration
- SparkFitness: dead-end forked repo, only useful as PhysioPal reference
