# Site Improvements & App Demo Brainstorm

**Context:** Roger brain-dumping his improvement priorities across all three properties

## Raw Transcript
> I've got a rambling to-do list on my brain for things we need to improve:
> 1. rogergimble.dev Website (a) The hamburger menu implementation screwed up the top bar and the area below it. (b) There is a weird blank block appearing underneath.
> 2. rodaco.co Website (a) While the whale graphic is good, we've lost some of the vibrant colors in the ocean, sky, and whale. (b) The BeerPair section is currently using a screenshot from the landing page instead of showing the app in actual use.
> 3. App Demonstrations (a) We should show the app being used with an agentmoltbot account, specifically the process of uploading a food image to get pairing results. (b) It would be much better to have a video capture of someone using the app live to generate results based on preferences like non-alcoholic, craft, or "surprise me."
> This is just a start for my brainstorming and notes, but I have a lot more to go over.

## Extracted Ideas

### rogergimbel.dev Bugs
- Hamburger menu broke the top nav bar layout
- Blank/empty block appearing below the nav area
- Both likely introduced in recent mobile nav update (commit defd4c3)

### rodaco.co Polish
- Whale hero colors still need work — ocean/sky/whale should be more vibrant, less washed out
- BeerPair section shows a landing page screenshot — should show the actual app in use

### BeerPair Demo Strategy
- Use agentmoltbot account for demo content
- Show the real flow: upload food photo → get pairing results
- Capture preference selection: non-alcoholic, craft, "surprise me"
- Video capture of live app usage would be far more compelling than static screenshots
- This could serve both rodaco.co AND beerpair.com

### Bigger Picture
- Roger flagged this as "just a start" — more items coming
- Pattern: all three properties need polish passes, not new features
- Demo content quality is becoming a priority (real usage > mockups)

- Related: knowledge/projects/rodaco-site/whale-hero.md (color vibrancy issue noted there too)
- Related: knowledge/projects/beerpair/summary.md
- Builds on: UGC campaign skill could generate demo videos
- Action potential: Video gen (Veo 3.1) or screen recording for app demo
