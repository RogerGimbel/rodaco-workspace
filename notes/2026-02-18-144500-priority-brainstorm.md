# Priority Brainstorm & Project Rankings

**Context:** Roger ranking his projects and giving context on each after a massive development session

## Raw Transcript
> 1. The hamburger menu broke the nav bar from a display perspective. It has a weird, blocky thing below it.
> 2. The whale colors on Rodaco could be more vibrant.
> 3. The Beerpair section needs real app screenshots — navigate the app, take screenshots or video of: upload image, get pairings, select preferences (non-alcoholic, craft, surprise me), get different results.
> 4. PhysioPal is back-burner but nice that it's transferred to Lovable for future polish.
> 5. BladeKeeper is my pet project because I'm a fucking blade fanatic. 31 outstanding knives. Want family to know about them. Want anyone in the world to display blade collections properly segmented, authorized, with sharing. First build got 20 instant sign-ups from European collectors — more hardcore than Americans.
> 6. Spark Fitness is a forked repo, useless except for gleaning ideas to improve PhysioPal.

## Key Insights
- BladeKeeper had 20 instant European sign-ups when first launched — proven market demand
- Roger is a blade collector with passion — this is personal AND has business potential
- BeerPair took 6 months solo; with current AI tooling could have been 3 days
- PhysioPal is back-burner but has value for elderly/post-surgery market
- SparkFitness is reference material only, not a product

## Extracted Priority Order
1. BladeKeeper collection UI (pet project + proven demand)
2. rogergimbel.dev nav bug fix (quick win)
3. rodaco.co whale colors + BeerPair demo content
4. BeerPair app screenshots/video for rodaco.co
5. PhysioPal polish (future)
6. rodaco.ai repurposing (future)
