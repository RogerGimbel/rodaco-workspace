## Overnight Build v2 (02:00 ET) — BladeKeeper P1 Attempt

### Task Selected
- Queue source: `memory/tasks/overnight-queue.md`
- Selected item: BladeKeeper P1 enhancement bucket (first unchecked: UI modernization focus via blade card design upgrade)

### Work Completed
- Updated file:
  - `projects/bladekeeper.app/src/components/collections/BladeCard.tsx`
- Change summary:
  - Added top-left blade type pill for faster scanability
  - Added top-right metadata chips (price + blade length when present)
  - Added icon-led chip styling (`Tag`, `Ruler`) with blurred glass treatment
  - Preserved existing image loading/error/retry and bottom overlay behavior

### Success Gate Outcome
- **Condition (2) met — blocked by external dependency/runtime environment issue.**

#### Blocker
- **Exact blocker:** Build toolchain crashes with `Bus error` during Vite build.
- **Evidence:**
  - `cd projects/bladekeeper.app && npm run build` → `Bus error` (exit 135)
  - `cd projects/bladekeeper.app && NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=2048' npm run build` → `Bus error` (exit 135)
- **Next unblocking action:** Diagnose runtime fault in this container (native binary/SWC/dependency artifact or host memory mapping issue), then rerun build and visual verification.
- **Smallest fallback task completed meanwhile:** Ran `npm run lint` and captured baseline; command runs but project has large pre-existing lint debt (120 errors / 22 warnings), not introduced by this specific UI change.

### Queue State
- Did **not** mark item complete in overnight queue due failed verification gate.
## Wikilink Sync (05:00 ET cron)

- Command: `node /home/node/workspace/bin/wikilink-sync`
- Result: ✅ Success
- Summary: Scanned 20 entities; **0 wikilinks added across 0 files**.
- Notes: No retry needed.
