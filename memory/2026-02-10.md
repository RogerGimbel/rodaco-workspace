# 2026-02-10

## Morning Brief
- Delivered morning brief to Roger at 5:31 AM EST
- Mission Control survived overnight (13.5h uptime, supervisor working)
- Weather service (wttr.in) unreachable from sandbox

## Pi Container Updates (In Progress)
- Roger asked to update containers with available updates
- Ran `docker compose pull` on Pi — many containers had updates (jellyfin, sonarr, radarr, lidarr, bazarr, prowlarr, tdarr, gluetun, netdata, portainer, uptime-kuma, etc.)
- Pulls completed, then `docker compose up -d` started
- Pi became unresponsive to SSH — likely maxed out on CPU/IO from recreating ~20+ containers simultaneously on ARM
- Still waiting for Pi to recover as of ~7:45 AM EST
- REMEMBER: If gluetun was recreated, must also recreate qbittorrent + sabnzbd

## MEMORY.md Update Requested
- Roger said "update them" at 7:18 AM — likely referring to memory files or open items
- Was interrupted by container update request before completing
