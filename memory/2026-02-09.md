# 2026-02-09

## OpenClaw Updated to 2026.2.9
- Updated from 2026.2.6 to 2026.2.9
- Key new features: iOS node app (alpha), Grok as web_search provider, agent management API, compaction dividers in Web UI, OPENCLAW_HOME override
- Key fixes: post-compaction amnesia (transcript writes now preserve parentId chain), Telegram quote parsing hardened, HTTP 400 now triggers model failover, context overflow recovery from oversized tool results, Voyage embeddings input_type for better memory search

## Skills Installed
- **github** — `gh` v2.86.0 installed to workspace/bin. Needs `gh auth login` with a PAT (repo scope).
- **nano-pdf** — v0.2.1 installed to workspace/pylib. Wrapper at workspace/bin/nano-pdf.
- **canvas** — Built-in, no CLI needed.
- **healthcheck** — Built-in, no CLI needed.
- **summarize** — Skill files copied but CLI is macOS-only (no Linux binary). Skipped per Roger. Using web_fetch/nano-pdf as alternatives.

## Mission Control Supervisor
- Recurring crash issue fixed permanently
- pm2 wouldn't work (read-only home filesystem in sandbox)
- Built bash supervisor at mission-control/supervisor.sh
- Auto-restarts on crash, circuit breaker (10 restarts/5min), PID dedup
- Updated start.sh to launch via supervisor
- Tested: killed server, confirmed auto-restart in ~2 seconds

## Roger's Dev Workflow
- Roger does all coding with: Claude Code, Lovable, Cursor, Replit, Bolt, Antigravity, Codex
- Has existing GitHub workflow that works well — don't push coding assistance unless asked
- gh CLI available for light tasks (PR status, issues) when he's ready

## Roger Asked About iOS Node App
- Walked Roger through the iOS node app capabilities: camera snap, location, screen recording, canvas/A2UI, notifications, voice wake
- Pairing flow: iOS app discovers gateway via Bonjour/Tailscale, then approve from gateway CLI
- Caveats: app must be foregrounded for camera/canvas/screen, still internal preview (not public yet)
- Roger seemed interested in the feature
