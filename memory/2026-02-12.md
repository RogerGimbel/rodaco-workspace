### Key Details
- Target: breweries ($3K-$10K/mo ad spend) and restaurants ($1.5K-$7K/mo ad spend)
- Stuart provided venue marketing research via docx (had to parse with Python due to garbled text)
- All assets are strategy/copy — NO code implementation yet

### Marketing Website HTML — Completed
- 3-tab HTML page: Consumer (B2C), Venue (B2B), Integrated Strategy
- File: `beerpair-deploy/index.html` (also `beerpair-marketing-plan.html`)
- Served via Mission Control: http://100.124.209.59:3333/beerpair-marketing-plan.html
- Also copied to Pi at `/tmp/beerpair-deploy/`

### Nano Banana Images — 10 Total
**B2B images** (generated earlier, in `knowledge/projects/beerpair/`):
- 2026-02-12-taproom-digital-menu.png, roi-visualization.png, venue-qr-experience.png, distributor-channel.png

**B2C images** (generated via sub-agent, in `beerpair-images/`):
- b2c-social-food-pairing.png, b2c-brewery-partnership.png, b2c-content-calendar.png, b2c-product-launch.png

**Integrated images**:
- integrated-flywheel.png, integrated-dashboard.png

All images copied to `beerpair-deploy/images/` and `mission-control/public/images/`

### Gateway Crash Recovery (~11:35 AM)
- Gateway crashed mid-task (was generating images + fixing HTML)
- All 6 sub-agent images survived the crash
- Recovered by reading daily notes, fixing paths, wiring in images, redeploying
- Lesson: sub-agent file writes persist even if gateway crashes after completion

### Deployed to presentations.rogergimbel.dev
- Caddy route already existed: `presentations.rogergimbel.dev` → `/mnt/media/presentations/`
- Deployed to: `/mnt/media/presentations/beerpair/` on Pi
- **Live URL:** https://presentations.rogergimbel.dev/beerpair/
- Old consumer-only presentation still at `presentation.html` in same dir
- Also served via Mission Control at http://100.124.209.59:3333/beerpair-marketing-plan.html

### File Locations Summary
- **Source HTML:** `beerpair-deploy/index.html` (workspace)
- **Images:** `beerpair-deploy/images/` (workspace), also `beerpair-images/` and `knowledge/projects/beerpair/`
- **Pi deployment:** `/mnt/media/presentations/beerpair/` (index.html + images/)
- **Mission Control:** `mission-control/public/beerpair-marketing-plan.html` + `mission-control/public/images/`
- **17 GTM asset docs:** Generated in conversation, need to be saved as individual files if not already

### Mission Control Mobile-First Redesign — Completed
- Full mobile-first CSS rewrite with 3 breakpoints: mobile (<640px), tablet (640-1024px), desktop (>1024px)
- **Mobile:** Bottom nav bar (5 icons + "More" overflow), compact header, collapsed system bar, stacked activity events, calendar day list, 44px touch targets, 12px padding
- **Tablet:** Top tabs (horizontal scroll), 2-col layouts, 7-col calendar, 16px padding
- **Desktop:** Unchanged from before
- Files changed: `style.css` (full rewrite), `index.html` (bottom nav + compact header), `app.js` (unified tab switching), `components/activity.js` (event markup)
- CSS braces balanced (308/308), all CSS variables preserved
- Live at http://100.124.209.59:3333

### New Skills & Systems Built (1:15-1:30 PM)
Built 3 systems from community best practices review:

1. **`/save` command** — `skills/save/SKILL.md` + `bin/save`. Memory flush + git commit. First commit captured 9,734 files (entire workspace).
2. **Video gen skill** — `skills/video-gen/SKILL.md` + `skills/video-gen/video-gen.sh`. Runway ML recommended. Needs API key from Roger.
3. **Get-to-know-you cron** — 110 questions in `knowledge/people/roger-gimbel/questions.json`, scripts in `skills/get-to-know-you/`. 3 cron jobs: Mon 10AM MT, Wed 2PM MT, Fri 11AM MT. First question fires tomorrow.

### Implementation Plans Created (MISSION_CONTROL.md)
Roger reviewed community best practices post, picked 4 items to implement:
1. `/save` command — memory sweep + git commit (High priority, small effort)
2. Video gen skill + API expansion (Medium priority, needs API research)
3. Grok data export to knowledge vault (Medium priority, needs Roger's data)
4. "Get to know you" cron — periodic questions to deepen understanding (High priority, small effort)
Full detailed plans with checkboxes in `MISSION_CONTROL.md`

### xAI Media Gen — Confirmed Working (1:34-1:51 PM)
- Discovered xAI has BOTH image and video gen via our API key
- **Image models:** `grok-imagine-image`, `grok-imagine-image-pro`, `grok-2-image-1212`
  - Endpoint: `POST /v1/images/generations` (sync, returns URL)
- **Video model:** `grok-imagine-video`
  - Endpoint: `POST /v1/videos/generations` (async, returns request_id)
  - Poll: `GET /v1/videos/{request_id}` → returns MP4 URL
  - ~20 seconds for 8-sec video
- **Google Veo 3.1** also available (`veo-3.1-generate-preview`) as fallback
- Built and tested both skills:
  - `skills/grok-image/` — grok-image.sh, tested 336KB PNG ✅
  - `skills/video-gen/` — video-gen.sh, tested 2.1MB MP4 ✅
  - Both support `--pro` flag
- Sent test video+image to Roger via Telegram

### Knowledge & Memory Updates (1:52 PM)
- Updated MEMORY.md: new skills, xAI media gen endpoints, /save command, get-to-know-you cron, removed duplicate section
- Updated MISSION_CONTROL.md: checked off all completed items (1, 2, 4), only #3 (Grok export) remains blocked
- First full /save commit captured entire workspace (9,734 files)
- Second /save committed all knowledge/memory updates

### AI Chat History Import Project (2:15 PM)

#### Grok Export (Done)
- Roger downloaded full Grok data export (22.6MB JSON)
- Copied to workspace: `prod-grok-backend.json`
- Structure: 246 conversations (1,990 messages), 1 project, 2 tasks, 36 media posts
- Date range: Jan 2025 → Feb 2026
- First convo: "Ocean One Marine brainstorm" (Jan 17, 2026)
- Plan: parse → categorize → distill into `knowledge/grok-history/` summaries
- Skip raw JSON in Obsidian — only distilled summaries go to knowledge graph

#### Claude Export (In Progress ~2:45 PM)
- Files copied: claude-conversations.json (574K), claude-memories.json (2K), claude-projects.json (19K)
- **Permission issue:** docker cp preserves Mac UID 501 ownership, container can't read
- Fix needed: `docker exec -u root moltbot-gateway chmod 644 /home/node/workspace/claude-*.json`
- Waiting for Roger to run chmod fix

#### Plan: Also import ChatGPT + Gemini exports
- ChatGPT: Settings → Data Controls → Export (email with zip, conversations.json)
- Gemini: Google Takeout → Gemini Apps (can take hours)
- Goal: Unified `knowledge/chat-history/` with source tags, same categories as Grok

#### Grok History Parsed
- Sub-agent parsed all 246 convos into `knowledge/grok-history/` (10 files, 3,135 lines)
- Categories: BeerPair(10), Ocean One(1), Rodaco(14), Technical(33), Research(13), Personal(175)
- Plus 36 media posts, 2 scheduled tasks
- Will rename to `knowledge/chat-history/` once all sources merged

### Docker Path Lesson (CRITICAL)
- **Roger got frustrated** about wrong workspace paths — burned into MEMORY.md permanently
- Workspace is Docker volume `moltbot_workspace`, NOT a bind mount
- No `/Users/rogergimbel/docker/openclaw/workspace/` exists on host
- Correct way to copy files in: `docker cp <file> moltbot-gateway:/home/node/workspace/`

### Still TODO
- Actual website code changes on beerpair.com

## Chat History Unification Project (3pm ET)
- Built unified parser (`parse-chat-history.py`) merging Grok (246) + Claude (10) = 256 conversations
- Output: `knowledge/chat-history/` with source tags, categories, INDEX.md
- Plan: `knowledge/chat-history/PLAN.md`
- Remaining: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity data dumps needed from Roger
- Roger working on ChatGPT export next
