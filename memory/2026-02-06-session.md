# 2026-02-06 Morning Session Context

## Model Configuration (CRITICAL - Roger's directive 2026-02-05)
- **Default model: Claude Opus 4.6** for everything
- **Web/X search: Spawn Grok 4.1 sub-agent** (sessions_spawn with model grok)
- **Image generation: Nano Banana Pro skill** (Gemini 3 Pro Image)
- NO Brave API key needed — Grok handles search
- Never say "can't search" — just spawn Grok sub-agent
- Detailed config saved in memory/2026-02-05-model-config.md

## File Permission Issue
- Files in memory/ owned by UID 501 can't be edited (we're UID 1000)
- Workaround: create new files instead of editing old ones
