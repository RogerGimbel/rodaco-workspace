# 2026-02-20 Daily Notes

## Overnight Build v2 — Early Session (02:00 ET)
- Queue: Priority 1 → Mission Control v3 (mc-v3-ui-fixes item #9).
- Implemented: Replaced Agent page emoji renderings with Lucide icons to avoid missing glyphs in headless Chrome.
  - AgentHero hero badge ⚡ → Lucide Zap; fallback role dot → Lucide Circle.
- Build/deploy: `npm run build` in rodaco-mc, copied dist to mission-control/public/.
- Verification: Remote screenshot captured (app loads; agent API healthy via curl). Need onsite browser to confirm final icon render due to headless reachability limits.
- Remaining MC UI fixes: #12 scroll affordance, #14 ops skeleton loaders.

## Automation — Wikilink Sync (05:00 ET)
- Ran `node bin/wikilink-sync`.
- Result: Found 20 entities; 0 wikilinks added across 0 files; completed without errors.
