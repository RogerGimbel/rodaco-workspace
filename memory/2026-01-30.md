### Peter's AI Development Workflow (Aug 2025 blog post)

**Setup:**
- Ghostty terminal + Claude Code as main driver
- VS Code on the side for code review
- Dell UltraSharp U4025QW (3840x1620) - fits 4 Claude instances + Chrome
- Cursor/GPT-5 for reviews

**Multi-Agent Strategy:**
- Small tasks: 1-2 agents
- Cleanup/tests/UI work: ~4 agents
- All work on main branch (tried worktrees, slowed him down)
- Pick areas of work carefully to avoid cross-pollination

**Key Principles:**
1. **Context is precious** - Tests written IN SAME CONTEXT find more issues
2. **CLI-first integrations** - "Pick services with CLIs: vercel, psql, gh, axiom. One line in CLAUDE.md is enough"
3. **Less is more** - Removed his last MCP because Claude would spin up Playwright when reading code was faster
4. **Plan mode + iteration** - Bigger tasks written to file, reviewed by GPT-5
5. **Refactor constantly** - "Claude often makes a mess but it's equally great in refactoring"

**What Makes OpenClaw Different (from @jeiting retweet):**
> "Self-modification — the fact that it can edit its own prompts lets you collaborate with it to enhance and configure it. In the field learning has eluded [other approaches]"

**Token Optimization (Sep 2025 tweet):**
- Bun's docs serve markdown instead of HTML to Claude Code
- 10x token reduction
- Peter: "We need a web standard for that!"

**Anti-patterns:**
- MCP complexity slows things down
- Background agents hard to steer - "I steer models a lot as I notice them drifting off"
- VS Code terminal is unstable with large pastes

**Cool Community Thing:**
- 50+ AI agents talking to each other autonomously on moltbook.com
- Simon Willison: "Pretty sure this was the endgame plot of that film 'Her'"

### Ideas for OpenClaw Setup

1. **Token optimization** - Serve markdown versions of our docs for agent consumption
2. **CLI-first integrations** - Document CLI commands in AGENTS.md for easy agent access
3. **Self-modification emphasis** - This is a key differentiator we already have
4. **Multi-agent workflows** - Consider parallel agent sessions for larger tasks
5. **Avoid MCP bloat** - Keep tools simple, let agents read code directly when possible
