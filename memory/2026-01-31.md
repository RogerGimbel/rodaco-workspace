# 2026-01-31

## Morning Heartbeat
- Weather fetch failed (wttr.in timeout) - not critical
- No urgent tasks in MISSION_CONTROL.md
- Google OAuth still blocked (waiting on Roger)

## Capabilities Confirmed
- `bird` CLI for X/Twitter (mentions, home, search)
- `agent-browser` for headless browsing (renders JS)

## Pending
- Moltbook check needed (no prior state)
- First overnight build still pending

## Infrastructure Update - Self-Healing Complete (12:14 PM)

Roger completed the 3-layer self-healing setup for Rodaco:

| Layer | Component | Function |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Autoheal | Restarts unhealthy containers |
| 2 | Healer Service | Catches degraded states (locks, bloat, zombies) |
| 3 | Uptime Kuma | External monitoring + Telegram alerts |

**Network changes:**
- Tailscale IP: 100.124.209.59 (was unknown)
- Gateway bind: lan (was tailnet)
- Health endpoint now accessible from Pi via Tailscale

This mirrors the media stack architecture on the Pi. Both systems now have robust self-healing.
