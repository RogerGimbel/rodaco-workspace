# BeerPair - Google Play Store Closed Testing

**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** In Progress - Need testers

## Current Status

- **Testers enrolled:** 4/12 (need 8 more)
- **Testing track:** Closed testing - Alpha
- **Feedback email:** support@beerpair.com

## Google Play Requirements

### The 12 Tester / 14 Day Rule

Google requires new personal developer accounts to:
1. Have **minimum 12 testers** opted-in
2. Testers must remain opted-in for **14 consecutive days**
3. After 14 days, apply for production access via questionnaire

### What Testers Must Do

- Opt-in via the closed testing link
- Stay opted-in for 14 days (don't need to use app daily)
- Must have real Google accounts

### What Testers DON'T Need To Do

- Open the app every day
- Keep it installed the whole time
- Provide formal feedback (though it helps)

## After 14 Days - Production Access Application

Google will ask 10 questions (~250-300 characters each):
- App purpose and functionality
- Target audience
- Testing process and feedback received
- Changes made based on testing
- Production readiness

### Tips to Get Approved

1. Push 2-3 releases during the 14 days (shows active development)
2. Collect real feedback (even informal)
3. Document changes made based on testing
4. Write detailed, honest questionnaire answers
5. Don't inflate tester count (80+ testers raises flags)

## Finding Testers

### Quick Options

1. **Personal network:** Dale, Stuart, family, friends with Android
2. **Reddit communities:**
   - r/TestMyApp
   - r/AndroidAppTesters
   - r/AlphaAndBetaUsers
3. **Testers Community:** testerscommunity.com (mutual testing)
