## Infrastructure Session — 07:00-08:15

### Completed 3 Infrastructure Projects
1. **Persistent Process Awareness** — `bin/system-state` queries host agent, MC health, Pi SSH in parallel → `memory/system-state.json`. MC Watchdog cron writes MC status as side effect.
2. **Smarter Context Management** — HEARTBEAT.md checks CURRENT.md staleness (>1h). Boot sequence: yesterday's notes only if today's missing. `bin/context-check` created. Auto-checkpoint triggers in AGENTS.md.
3. **Remote Screenshots** — `bin/remote-screenshot` uses Chrome headless on M5 MacBook (`rogergimbel@100.71.128.20`), SCPs to `/tmp/`. Tested with MC homepage (59KB).

### Config Changes
- `tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false` — kills ⚠️ background process notifications in Telegram
- `channels.telegram.streamMode: "block"` — stops ⚠️ tool call spam (replies appear all at once)
- Overnight build cron updated to use `bin/remote-screenshot`

### Pending
- Roger asked about Opus 4.6 1M context window via API — fetched Anthropic docs HTML via curl but need to parse/relay
- Roger wants to discuss new ambitious projects (not yet specified)
- Current OpenClaw config `contextWindow: 200000` — may need updating for 1M

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:03
api fix: P0 fixes — model pricing (was unknown, now real rates), cost tracking (was sh, now calculated from tokens ~0 total), sub-agent count (was 1236 all-time, now 717 last-24h)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:06
api fix: P1 fixes — performance metrics now shows real tool timing (image 22s, exec 1.15s), metrics/costs fixed to use session aggregation properly, usage/providers now shows session-level usage per provider (anthropic: $21.16, 321 calls)

## MC API Fixes Summary (subagent: mc-api-fixes)

### P0 — All 3 completed ✅
1. **Model pricing** — Added `MODEL_PRICING` map in api-v3.js + `lookupModelPricing()`. Now returns real rates (e.g. opus $15/$75 per 1M, sonnet $3/$15). `image` and `auto` aliases show `unknown:true` (no match in pricing map).
2. **Cost tracking $0** — Added `SESSION_MODEL_PRICING` map + `calculateCost()` in session-parser.js. Costs calculated from token counts when provider reports 0. Total cost now ~$20-21 from 30 sessions.
3. **Sub-agent count inflated** — Fixed `system-overview` to filter sessions by mtime > 24h ago. Now reports `subAgentCount` (24h=717) and `subAgentCountTotal` (all-time=1236).

### P1 — All 3 completed ✅
4. **Performance metrics zeros** — Rewrote `/metrics/performance` to measure actual tool call latency from assistant→toolResult timestamp deltas. Now shows: image 22s, exec 1.15s, process 1.42s.
5. **Cost trend null** — Fixed `/metrics/costs` to use session file aggregation (was calling `parseSessionUsage(30)` with number instead of path). Now returns today=$8.57, week=$20.91, month=$20.91. Trend still null (no prior-week data yet, correct).
6. **Usage by provider** — Enhanced `/usage/providers` to include `sessionUsage` aggregated from JSONL files. Now shows anthropic: $21.16/321 calls. Other providers (openai/xai/gemini) show 0 (only anthropic models used currently).

### Files changed
- `/home/node/workspace/mission-control/src/routes/api-v3.js`
- `/home/node/workspace/mission-control/src/lib/session-parser.js`

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:07
overnight build: frontend fixes complete (P0-P2), build deployed; API sub-agent fixed P0+P1 (pricing, cost calc, session counts, perf metrics)

## 📌 Overnight Build Run — 02:00-02:10 ET

### Crash Recovery
- git diff: No code changes from previous sessions (only meta files: AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md, CURRENT.md)
- MC API: Running at startup (uptime ~5925s). Sub-agent stopped/restarted during API edits.

### API Sub-Agent (mc-api-fixes, claude-sonnet-4-5)
Completed all P0 + P1 items:
- Model pricing: Real costs now shown (opus $15/$75, sonnet $3/$15, grok $3/$15)
- Cost tracking: Calculated from tokens — $8.57 today, $20.91 week total
- Sub-agent count: 717 (24h) vs 1236 all-time
- Performance metrics: Real tool latency (image 22s, exec 1.15s, process 1.42s)
- Cost trend: Fixed query bug; trend=null correct (no prior week data)
- Usage by provider: anthropic $21.16 / 321 calls

### Frontend Fixes (main session)
Completed 11/14 UI items:
- P0 (3/3): Badge contrast, BeerPair tag solid color, Knowledge categories verified
- P1 (5/5): Backup note unicode fix, duplicate label, latency color, cost toggle, ops hint
- P2 (3/6): DeviceCard wrapping, health bar label contrast, help button visibility

Build: ✅ Clean in 9.82s. Deployed to mission-control/public/.

### Screenshots
6 pages screenshotted. Pages showed loading state in some captures (Chrome takes instant screenshot; React SPA needs ~3-5s to fetch API data). Code verified correct via source review.

### Remaining
UI: 3 items (#9 emoji, #12 scroll fade, #14 skeleton timing)
API: 4 items (P2 enhancements: model breakdown, session count logic, latency tracking, lock cleanup)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:08
overnight build DONE: 11/14 UI fixes deployed, 6/6 API P0+P1 fixed (pricing, costs, session counts, perf metrics, provider usage)

## 05:00 — Wikilink Sync (cron)
- Found 11 entities across people, projects, infrastructure, companies
- Added 1 wikilink to: Mission Control Dashboard
- Result: 1 wikilink added across 1 file

## 📌 Checkpoint — 09:45

## 📌 Checkpoint — 10:40

### Rodaco Site Brief — Round 2 Answers
- **rodaco.co** is primary. rodaco.ai is a dead prototype chatbot (vector/semantic search experiment ~6mo ago)
- **Target audience:** clients (hire us to build AI products), partners, investors
- **BeerPair** = only polished flagship product, should be featured. Web app solid, native apps coming.
- **Other projects (NOT ready to showcase):** knife collection manager, self-help site (partial), PT guidance/nagging app (for Roger's dad), carnivore supplement tracker
- **Content:** No case studies yet. Simple "who we are / what we believe" section. Feature BeerPair.
- Remove the click-through to rodaco.ai from current site

## 📌 Checkpoint — 10:35

### Rodaco Corporate Site — Full Buildout Initiated
Roger provided comprehensive brief for rodaco.co corporate site:
- **Goal:** Full corporate site (about, services, team, contact) — NOT stodgy, future-looking
- **Company:** AI innovation firm, 3 partners with 35+ years combined full-stack experience
- **Team:** Roger (Denver, tech lead), Dale (Florida, technical + paying bills), Stuart (NJ, marketing research)
- **Focus:** AI dev, SaaS (evolving), B2C/B2B, agent-driven software
- **Philosophy:** "Bitstream in, bitstream out" — agents build everything, ideas + architecture matter
- **Founded:** ~early 2025, recognized vibe coding revolution
- **Current site:** Just a placeholder (video bg + "RODACO" text, clicks to rodaco.ai)
- **Access model:** Only Roger can make changes (his hardware), Dale+Stuart via Telegram for research only
- Knowledge file updated: knowledge/projects/rodaco-site/summary.md
- Fixed sites watchdog cron: main→isolated session (was burning main context every 2 min)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 10:30
