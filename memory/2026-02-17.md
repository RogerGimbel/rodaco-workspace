## Infrastructure Session — 07:00-08:15

### Completed 3 Infrastructure Projects
1. **Persistent Process Awareness** — `bin/system-state` queries host agent, MC health, Pi SSH in parallel → `memory/system-state.json`. MC Watchdog cron writes MC status as side effect.
2. **Smarter Context Management** — HEARTBEAT.md checks CURRENT.md staleness (>1h). Boot sequence: yesterday's notes only if today's missing. `bin/context-check` created. Auto-checkpoint triggers in AGENTS.md.
3. **Remote Screenshots** — `bin/remote-screenshot` uses Chrome headless on M5 MacBook (`rogergimbel@100.71.128.20`), SCPs to `/tmp/`. Tested with MC homepage (59KB).

### Config Changes
- `tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false` — kills ⚠️ background process notifications in Telegram
- `channels.telegram.streamMode: "block"` — stops ⚠️ tool call spam (replies appear all at once)
- Overnight build cron updated to use `bin/remote-screenshot`

### Pending
- Roger asked about Opus 4.6 1M context window via API — fetched Anthropic docs HTML via curl but need to parse/relay
- Roger wants to discuss new ambitious projects (not yet specified)
- Current OpenClaw config `contextWindow: 200000` — may need updating for 1M

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:03
api fix: P0 fixes — model pricing (was unknown, now real rates), cost tracking (was sh, now calculated from tokens ~0 total), sub-agent count (was 1236 all-time, now 717 last-24h)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:06
api fix: P1 fixes — performance metrics now shows real tool timing (image 22s, exec 1.15s), metrics/costs fixed to use session aggregation properly, usage/providers now shows session-level usage per provider (anthropic: $21.16, 321 calls)

## MC API Fixes Summary (subagent: mc-api-fixes)

### P0 — All 3 completed ✅
1. **Model pricing** — Added `MODEL_PRICING` map in api-v3.js + `lookupModelPricing()`. Now returns real rates (e.g. opus $15/$75 per 1M, sonnet $3/$15). `image` and `auto` aliases show `unknown:true` (no match in pricing map).
2. **Cost tracking $0** — Added `SESSION_MODEL_PRICING` map + `calculateCost()` in session-parser.js. Costs calculated from token counts when provider reports 0. Total cost now ~$20-21 from 30 sessions.
3. **Sub-agent count inflated** — Fixed `system-overview` to filter sessions by mtime > 24h ago. Now reports `subAgentCount` (24h=717) and `subAgentCountTotal` (all-time=1236).

### P1 — All 3 completed ✅
4. **Performance metrics zeros** — Rewrote `/metrics/performance` to measure actual tool call latency from assistant→toolResult timestamp deltas. Now shows: image 22s, exec 1.15s, process 1.42s.
5. **Cost trend null** — Fixed `/metrics/costs` to use session file aggregation (was calling `parseSessionUsage(30)` with number instead of path). Now returns today=$8.57, week=$20.91, month=$20.91. Trend still null (no prior-week data yet, correct).
6. **Usage by provider** — Enhanced `/usage/providers` to include `sessionUsage` aggregated from JSONL files. Now shows anthropic: $21.16/321 calls. Other providers (openai/xai/gemini) show 0 (only anthropic models used currently).

### Files changed
- `/home/node/workspace/mission-control/src/routes/api-v3.js`
- `/home/node/workspace/mission-control/src/lib/session-parser.js`

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:07
overnight build: frontend fixes complete (P0-P2), build deployed; API sub-agent fixed P0+P1 (pricing, cost calc, session counts, perf metrics)

## 📌 Overnight Build Run — 02:00-02:10 ET

### Crash Recovery
- git diff: No code changes from previous sessions (only meta files: AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md, CURRENT.md)
- MC API: Running at startup (uptime ~5925s). Sub-agent stopped/restarted during API edits.

### API Sub-Agent (mc-api-fixes, claude-sonnet-4-5)
Completed all P0 + P1 items:
- Model pricing: Real costs now shown (opus $15/$75, sonnet $3/$15, grok $3/$15)
- Cost tracking: Calculated from tokens — $8.57 today, $20.91 week total
- Sub-agent count: 717 (24h) vs 1236 all-time
- Performance metrics: Real tool latency (image 22s, exec 1.15s, process 1.42s)
- Cost trend: Fixed query bug; trend=null correct (no prior week data)
- Usage by provider: anthropic $21.16 / 321 calls

### Frontend Fixes (main session)
Completed 11/14 UI items:
- P0 (3/3): Badge contrast, BeerPair tag solid color, Knowledge categories verified
- P1 (5/5): Backup note unicode fix, duplicate label, latency color, cost toggle, ops hint
- P2 (3/6): DeviceCard wrapping, health bar label contrast, help button visibility

Build: ✅ Clean in 9.82s. Deployed to mission-control/public/.

### Screenshots
6 pages screenshotted. Pages showed loading state in some captures (Chrome takes instant screenshot; React SPA needs ~3-5s to fetch API data). Code verified correct via source review.

### Remaining
UI: 3 items (#9 emoji, #12 scroll fade, #14 skeleton timing)
API: 4 items (P2 enhancements: model breakdown, session count logic, latency tracking, lock cleanup)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 02:08
overnight build DONE: 11/14 UI fixes deployed, 6/6 API P0+P1 fixed (pricing, costs, session counts, perf metrics, provider usage)

## 05:00 — Wikilink Sync (cron)
- Found 11 entities across people, projects, infrastructure, companies
- Added 1 wikilink to: Mission Control Dashboard
- Result: 1 wikilink added across 1 file

## 📌 Checkpoint — 21:45 (UGC Campaign — FULL PIPELINE SUCCESS 🎉)

### Full 4-Scene BeerPair UGC Campaign Generated
- Pipeline ran end-to-end in ~3 minutes, cost ~$1.50
- Character: blonde messy bun, cozy sweater, craft beer lover vibe (3 reference shots)
- 4 scenes: Dinner Prep Dilemma → Overwhelmed by Choice → Aha Moment → Perfect Pairing
- All videos 9:16 portrait, 3.4-5.9MB each, character consistent across scenes
- Brief + character + 4 videos all sent to Roger via Telegram

### Pipeline Performance
| Step | Time | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| Creative Brief (Gemini Flash) | ~10s | 4-scene story arc JSON |
| Character Gen (Nano Banana Pro) | ~30s | 3 consistent reference images |
| Video Scene ×4 (Veo 3.1) | ~25-35s each | 3.4-5.9MB mp4 each |
| **Total** | **~3 min** | **~$1.50** |

### Skill Location
`skills/ugc-campaign/` — 6 scripts + templates + SKILL.md
Knowledge: `knowledge/projects/ugc-campaign/summary.md`

## 📌 Checkpoint — 21:35 (UGC Campaign Skill Built + Tested)

### UGC Campaign Skill — WORKING
Built `skills/ugc-campaign/` — full pipeline for generating UGC video campaigns from a product photo + brand description.

**Components (all tested ✅):**
- `creative-brief.sh` — Gemini Flash analyzes brand → generates 4-scene story arc with video prompts
- `generate-character.sh` — Nano Banana Pro → 3 consistent character reference shots (portrait, candid, action)
- `generate-video.py` — Veo 3.1 Python SDK with reference images for character consistency
- `generate-video.sh` — bash wrapper around Python script (uv run)
- `stitch-videos.sh` — ffmpeg via M5 MacBook SSH (built, untested)
- `ugc-campaign.sh` — main orchestrator
- `templates/beerpair-launch.json` — BeerPair-specific scene templates

**Test results:**
- Creative brief: ~10s, produces 4 scenes with story arc (hook→problem→discovery→result)
- Character gen: ~30s, 3 shots, highly consistent (dark brown hair messy bun, vintage band tee, jeans)
- Video gen: ~25s, 4.8MB mp4, reference image worked for character consistency
- Total test cost: ~$0.50-0.75
- Estimated full 4-scene campaign: ~$2-3

**Key technical discovery:** REST `predictLongRunning` endpoint does NOT support `referenceImages`. Must use Python SDK `client.models.generate_videos()` with `types.GenerateVideosConfig(reference_images=[...])`. Reference type is "asset".

**Test artifacts in /tmp/:**
- `/tmp/ugc-test-brief.json` — creative brief
- `/tmp/ugc-test-character/` — 3 character images
- `/tmp/ugc-test-scene-1.mp4` — first video scene

**Next: Run full 4-scene pipeline end-to-end for BeerPair**

### Also This Session
- Sites watchdog bumped from 2min → 5min (was interrupting main session with system messages)

## 📌 Checkpoint — 18:30 (Final session checkpoint)

### Everything Deployed
1. **Sonnet 4.6** across ALL 11 cron jobs + 16 workflow agents + heartbeat + fallback
2. **1M context windows** for Opus 4.6 + Sonnet 4.6 (Tier 4 confirmed, beta header active)
3. **Overnight Build v2**: queue-based, multi-project, 1M context, 40 min timeout
4. **Daily Site Health Check** (6 AM ET): HTTP, content sanity, SSL, response times, production URLs
5. **Weekly Browser Site Audit** (Sun 3 AM ET): full screenshot, mobile viewport, click-through
6. **Morning Brief** updated to include health check results
7. **Three-tier monitoring**: watchdog (2 min) → CLI health (daily) → browser audit (weekly)

### Files Created/Updated
- `memory/tasks/overnight-queue.md` — task queue for overnight builds
- `memory/tasks/overnight-build-v2-plan.md` — design doc
- `memory/tasks/site-health-plan.md` — monitoring architecture
- `TOOLS.md` — model routing updated for 4.6 + 1M context

### Anthropic API Migration
- Switched from Claude Code OAuth → regular Anthropic API key
- Bought $447 in credits ($87 + $160 + $200)
- Tier 4 confirmed (rate limits: 4K RPM, 2M ITPM <200K, 1M ITPM 200K-1M)
- $459.66 remaining balance, auto-reload $20 when hits $10

## 📌 Checkpoint — 18:15

### Tier 4 Confirmed + 1M Context Live
- Roger bought $447 in credits → Tier 4 confirmed on Limits page
- Context windows bumped back to 1M for both Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6
- Beta header `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07` active
- Rate limits: 4K RPM, 2M ITPM (<200K), 1M ITPM (200K-1M)
- Switched from Claude Code OAuth to regular Anthropic API key

### Next: Steps 3-5
- Step 3: Plan ambitious overnight builds (full features, not just fixes)
- Step 4: Plan computer-use testing cron (weekly click-through of 3 sites)
- Step 5: Plan weekly automated CLI health check of all 3 sites

## 📌 Checkpoint — 18:06 (Pre-compaction flush)

### Anthropic API Key + Tier Situation
- Roger switched from Claude Code OAuth to a regular Anthropic API key
- Hit Tier 1 rate limits on restart (crash loop from hammering API)
- Upgraded to Tier 2, then bought credits: $87 + $160 + $200 = $447 cumulative
- Console still shows **Tier 3** despite exceeding $400 Tier 4 threshold — may need time to propagate
- **Context windows reverted to 200K** until Tier 4 confirmed (1M requires Tier 4)
- `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07` header still in config (harmless, just enables option)
- Auto-reload enabled: $20 when balance hits $10

### Config Changes This Session
1. Sonnet 4.6 deployed across all 16 Sonnet agents + heartbeat + fallback
2. Context bumped to 1M → **reverted back to 200K** (Tier 3 limitation)
3. Sites watchdog cron fixed (main→isolated)
4. TOOLS.md model routing updated for Sonnet 4.6

### Pending TODO (from Sonnet 4.6 planning)
- [ ] Plan ambitious overnight builds (full features, not just fixes)
- [ ] Plan computer-use testing cron (weekly click-through of 3 sites)
- [ ] Plan weekly automated CLI health check of all 3 sites
- [ ] Bump context to 1M once Tier 4 confirmed
- [ ] Clean stale `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` alias from config

### Tier 4 Advancement
- Threshold: $400 cumulative credit purchases
- Roger's total: $447 — should auto-advance, check Limits page tomorrow
- If still Tier 3 tomorrow, contact Anthropic support

## 📌 Checkpoint — 14:35

### Sonnet 4.6 Upgrade + Context Window + Workflow Improvements
- **Sonnet 4.6 deployed:** All 16 Sonnet agents + heartbeat + fallback upgraded from 4.5→4.6
- Config patch applied, gateway restarted, doctor passed clean
- Sonnet 4.6 registered in model registry with correct pricing ($3/$15, 64K max output)
- Old sonnet-4-5 alias entry still in config (harmless, can clean later)

**Next steps (to do):**
1. Bump contextWindow to 1M for both Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 in config
2. Plan ambitious overnight builds (full features, not just fixes)
3. Plan computer-use testing cron (weekly automated click-through of all 3 sites)
4. Plan weekly automated CLI auth of all 3 sites
5. Update TOOLS.md model routing section for Sonnet 4.6
