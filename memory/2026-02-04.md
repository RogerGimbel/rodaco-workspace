# Daily Notes - 2026-02-04

## Overnight Build (2:00 AM)

### Media Stack Health Check ✅
- **Containers:** All 30 running, 0 unhealthy
- **Disk:** 33% used (569G/1.8T), 1.2T available
- **VPN:** Working (89.187.177.72 via Gluetun)

### Media Stack Improvement: Docker Cleanup ✅
- Pruned dangling images
- **Reclaimed:** 169MB (27 images removed)
- Git repo healthy - 3 commits, last: "Fix healthchecks: homarr (curl->wget), wetty (IPv6->IPv4)"

### Claude Code Research: OpenClaw Skills Deep Dive ✅

Discovered OpenClaw ships with 54 skills, many we're not using:

**High-Priority to Install:**
1. **github** - needs `gh` CLI, enables PR/issue management
2. **mcporter** - needs `npm i -g mcporter`, direct MCP server access
3. **clawhub** - skill marketplace CLI

**Key Learnings:**
- coding-agent skill: orchestrate Codex/Claude Code with PTY mode
- PTY is essential for interactive CLIs (`pty:true`)
- Many home automation skills available (hue, sonos, cameras)

Updated `memory/claude-code-research.md` with findings.

### Rodaco Tasks
- Checked MISSION_CONTROL.md - no urgent small tasks
- BeerPair marketing templates ready (created 02-02)
- Waiting on native apps + landing page before marketing execution

## Morning Session with Roger (9 AM)

### New Tools Installed
- **mcporter** v0.7.3 → `~/workspace/bin/mcporter` (MCP server bridge)
- **nano-pdf** v0.2.1 → `~/workspace/bin/nano-pdf` (AI-powered PDF editing)

Both installed to workspace directory (container filesystem is read-only for system paths).

### Skills Discussion
Roger interested in:
- Home control (openhue, sonoscli, camsnap) — needs hardware
- PDF editing ✅ installed
- Health monitoring (clarified: it's security hardening, not uptime)
- mcporter ✅ installed
- Apple Notes & iMessage — need macOS host access (deferred)
