# MC v3 Frontend Browse — 2026-02-16

## Setup
- **Local clone:** `/home/node/workspace/rodaco-mc/` (also on host at `/Users/rogergimbel/rodaco-mc/`)
- **Dev server:** Running on host at port **3334** (`http://100.124.209.59:3334/`)
- **API:** `VITE_API_URL=http://100.124.209.59:3333`
- **Lovable deployment (rodaco-mc.lovable.app):** DEAD — returns 404 "Project not found"
- **Agent browser:** `agent-browser 0.10.0` — working fine with `--headless` + screenshot/snapshot/click
- **Screenshots saved:** `mc-screenshots/01-home.png` through `06-research.png`

## Page-by-Page Findings

### 1. HOME (`/`)
**What works:** System overview with 15s auto-refresh, device cards (MacBook + Pi), health score gauge (100), recent wins, cost analytics, cron jobs, activity feed, usage charts.

**Issues:**
- BUILD text truncated in metrics bar ("Overnight Build — Miss...")
- MacBook RAM bar is red (87% = 13/15GB) but machine last seen "11d 7h" — stale data shown as "Healthy"
- DOCKER/MEDIA labels overlap values on Pi card
- System Health horizontal bars have no labels
- Device cards have inconsistent heights
- "Degraded" status banner content faded/obscured on right side

### 2. OPS (`/ops`)
**What works:** Tabs for Tasks/Goals/Overnight/Suggested(5), shows active infrastructure overhaul task.

**Issues:**
- Task title text appears blurred/low contrast — major readability bug
- Only 1 task shown, vast empty space, no empty state guidance
- No "Create Task" button
- Tab counts inconsistent (only Suggested shows count)
- Low information density

### 3. AGENT (`/agent`)
**What works:** Identity card with Rodaco name + model, 4 role cards (CEO/CTO/CIO/CMO), personality section, traits section.

**Issues:**
- Role descriptions, personality text heavily blurred/unreadable
- Agent identity card has wasted whitespace
- Traits section cut off at viewport bottom with no scroll indicator
- Tab active state distinction weak (Status/Models/Sessions/Providers)

### 4. PROJECTS (`/projects`)
**What works:** BeerPair + Ocean One tabs, momentum sparkline (4-week trend), project overview card, credits/app store/assets metrics, tech stack tags.

**Issues:**
- Momentum week ordering confusing (W1=29 shown as "29 mentions this week" but W4=0 is latest?)
- Credits green dot indicator has no label
- Tech stack tags may overflow on narrow screens
- No edit/action buttons — purely informational
- Content below tech stack cut off

### 5. KNOWLEDGE (`/knowledge`)
**What works:** Growth chart (46 files, 8 categories, +74% in 3d), category filter pills, entity cards with connection/section counts, progress bars.

**Issues:**
- "Other" category appears 4 times in filters — categorization bug
- Entity names truncated with ellipsis, no tooltip
- Chart x-axis spacing non-linear (skips Feb 13)
- "conns" and "sects" abbreviations unexplained
- Progress bar colors have no legend
- Only 3 of 8 categories visible, no horizontal scroll affordance

### 6. RESEARCH (`/research`)
**What works:** Kanban board (Ideas/In Progress/Completed), marketing ideas with project tags + categories, filter dropdowns, "+ New Idea" button.

**Issues:**
- Card titles blurred/semi-transparent — readability bug
- All 9 items in Ideas column, other two empty — visually lopsided
- No drag-and-drop visual cues
- No scroll indicator for long Ideas list
- Empty columns say "No items yet" with no CTA

## Cross-Cutting Issues (All Pages)
1. **Text rendering:** Multiple pages show blurred/low-contrast text — may be a CSS issue with text color or opacity on the glass card backgrounds
2. **No dark mode despite toggle:** Light theme shown everywhere, dark mode button visible but apparently not applied
3. **Stale data indicators:** No visual distinction between fresh and stale data
4. **No loading/skeleton states visible** — may exist but not tested
5. **Help button (?) on every page** — unclear what it does
6. **Breadcrumbs redundant** with tab state on most pages

## Priority Improvements (Suggested Iteration Plan)

### P0 — Fix Broken Stuff
1. Fix text rendering/blur issue across Ops, Agent, Research pages (likely CSS opacity or color)
2. Fix "Other" x4 categorization bug on Knowledge page
3. Fix stale data — mark devices as "stale" if last seen >1h, don't show "Healthy"

### P1 — Quick UX Wins
4. Add labels to System Health bars on Home
5. Fix entity name truncation (tooltip or wider cards) on Knowledge
6. Fix momentum week ordering display on Projects
7. Add scroll indicators where content is cut off

### P2 — Missing Functionality
8. Add task creation on Ops page
9. Add drag-and-drop for Research kanban
10. Implement dark mode properly (toggle exists but doesn't work?)
11. Add entity detail modal/page on Knowledge

### P3 — Polish
12. Consistent tab count badges across all tabs
13. Better empty states with CTAs
14. Tooltip explanations for abbreviations (conns, sects)
15. Responsive testing on mobile breakpoints
