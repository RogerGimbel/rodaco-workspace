## Mission Control v3 (continued from Feb 13)
- Generated comprehensive Lovable prompt with all 25 endpoint response shapes for full 6-page sync
- Saved API reference to `knowledge/projects/mission-control-v3/api-reference.md`
- Roger needs to paste the comprehensive prompt into Lovable for Ops/Agent/Knowledge/Research pages

## Pi Media Stack — Homepage Dashboard Fix
- **Problem:** qBittorrent and SABnzbd showing "API Error" on `admin.rogergimbel.dev` (Homepage dashboard)
- **Investigation:** Containers healthy, APIs responding, Homarr (wrong app!) was fine
- **Root cause:** `admin.rogergimbel.dev` is served by **Homepage** container (port 3000), not Homarr
  - Homepage config used host IP `10.0.0.20:8090/8183` to reach qBit/SABnzbd
  - UFW DOCKER-USER firewall (hardened Feb 13) blocks container→host loopback traffic
  - So Homepage couldn't reach the services via published ports
- **Fix:** Changed `/mnt/media/config/homepage/services.yaml`:
  - qBit: `http://10.0.0.20:8090` → `http://gluetun:8081`
  - SABnzbd: `http://10.0.0.20:8183` → `http://gluetun:8080`
- **Red herring:** Temporarily pinned Homarr to 0.15.10 thinking it was the problem — reverted to latest
- **Lesson:** Always use Docker internal DNS for container-to-container communication, not host IP + published ports

## OpenClaw
