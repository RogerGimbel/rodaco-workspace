# Site Audit First Pass — 2026-02-21

## Scope
- rodaco.co
- rogergimbel.dev

## Objective
Ensure both sites are:
1. Clear to average technically literate visitors
2. Credible and non-embarrassing to industry leaders (e.g., Musk/Karpathy/YC/OpenClaw ecosystem)

## Executive Summary
Both sites are visually strong but under-index on proof. They currently communicate taste and ambition better than measurable credibility. Main gap: hard evidence, technical trust artifacts, and clearer audience paths.

## Cross-Site Findings
- Strong design baseline and modern aesthetic
- Messaging conviction is good, but too much abstraction in places
- Not enough above-the-fold proof (outcomes, metrics, artifacts)
- CTA architecture is generic (needs intent-based routing)
- Add accessibility hardening and reduced-motion support for polished professionalism

## rodaco.co — Findings
### Strengths
- Distinct visual identity
- Strong hero presence
- Clear sectioning and narrative flow

### Risks
- Hero atmosphere outweighs credibility signal
- Technical depth and outcomes are below fold
- Team/story lacks concrete proof links

### Priority Recommendations
1. Reduce logo dominance; elevate value proposition + proof strip
2. Add above-the-fold trust rail (metrics/logos/outcomes)
3. Convert BeerPair block into mini case study (problem → build → measurable result)
4. Add explicit engagement models (who it is for, what to buy)
5. Add technical trust artifacts (process, reliability, governance)

## rogergimbel.dev — Findings
### Strengths
- Strong personal authority voice
- Good career continuity/timeline framing

### Risks
- Loading/fallback experience can feel unfinished
- "Coming soon" weakens public polish
- Not enough receipts (specific outcomes/work snapshots)

### Priority Recommendations
1. Replace placeholders with 2–3 real pieces of writing/build notes
2. Add Selected Work with measurable outcomes
3. Add explicit offer framing for client fit
4. Harden fallback/loading UX
5. Add concise operator principles section

## Accessibility + Quality Checklist
- WCAG contrast pass on secondary text and controls
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Keyboard/focus-visible review
- Mobile-first QA for every major visual change
- Keep OG tags/images maintained and validated

## Creative Direction Ideas
- Public Build Ledger (recent shipped work and outcomes)
- Interactive agentic stack diagram (proposal → approval → apply → audit)
- Proof-over-portfolio cards (Context / Constraint / Build / Outcome)
- Technical manifesto: what Rodaco will and won’t do
- Intent-based CTA split for founders/operators/enterprise

## Proposed Next Phase
- Convert this audit into implementation-ready specs after additional founder/company context from Roger.
- Keep BeerPair app repos off-limits until explicit clearance.
