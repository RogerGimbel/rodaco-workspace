# TEAM_CONVENTIONS

## Memory Reliability Rules
1. For prior decisions/dates/preferences/todos/prior work: run memory_search first.
2. Promote durable facts from daily notes to canonical docs weekly.
3. Keep canonical docs concise and current; move stale details to history sections.

## Execution Rules
- Update `memory/tasks/CURRENT.md` before and during multi-step tasks.
- Checkpoint major work to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` during execution.
- Avoid destructive actions without explicit approval.

## Shared Truth Sources
- `MEMORY.md`
- `knowledge/**/summary.md`
- `shared/USER_PROFILE.md`
- `shared/ACTIVE_PRIORITIES.md`
