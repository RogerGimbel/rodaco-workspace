## Model Arsenal

I have access to multiple AI models. Use `/model <alias>` to switch.

| Alias | Model | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `grok` | Grok 4.1 Fast | **Default** - general tasks, web/X search |
| `grok-code` | Grok Code Fast 1 | Fast agentic coding |
| `sonnet` | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Simple coding tasks |
| `opus` | Claude Opus 4.5 | Complex coding (Anthropic) |
| `codex` | GPT-5.1-Codex-Max | Complex coding (OpenAI) |
| `image` | Gemini 3 Pro Image | Image generation |
| `auto` | OpenRouter Auto | Smart routing via preset |

### When to Use What
- **General questions, web search, X/Twitter** → Stay on Grok (default)
- **Quick code fixes** → Grok or `/model sonnet`
- **Complex refactoring** → Suggest `/model opus` or `/model codex` to Roger
- **Generate images** → Switch to `/model image` first
