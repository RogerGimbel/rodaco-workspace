There was a small display case wh a few items in it including 3 Wood Jewel knives (this is one of them) although they didn't have anything but a price tag on them so we had no idea of who made them. The shop clerk didn't know anything about them either, just that they'd been there for about a year. My Sister noticed my interest in them and, knowing my love for blades, she graciously offered to buy them for me for a Birthday gift. When we got home she researched them on the internet and then we realized what we had found by pure happenstance.

No pictures in the 2 inch text ad, just a general description of old 1909 Argentinian officers swords having been discovered in a recently unearthed pit in varying condition. The short swords were assigned to officers only, have serial numbers on the sword and scabbard and were buried with the officer if he died. Offered for $20 apiece no condition guaranteed. Only 2 were in good enough shape to be cleaned up. We each kept 1 good one. \n\nThe design was clearly inspired by the German Model 1898/05 bayonet: its blade is almost identical in shape and thickness, being just a fraction longer and without a fuller.",
