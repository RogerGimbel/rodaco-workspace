# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

## Save Command

**Trigger:** `/save`, `save`, or `save <summary>`
**Skill:** `skills/save/SKILL.md`
**Script:** `bin/save`

Workflow:
1. Flush session context → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Extract durable facts → `knowledge/` entries
3. Update `MEMORY.md` if permanent lessons learned
4. Run `bash bin/save "<summary>"` (git add + commit + push)
5. Report results

The script always exits 0. If no changes exist, it says so and moves on.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

# Antfarm Workflows

Antfarm CLI (always use full path to avoid PATH issues):

Commands:
- Install: `node ~/.openclaw/workspace/antfarm/dist/cli/cli.js workflow install <name>`
- Run: `node ~/.openclaw/workspace/antfarm/dist/cli/cli.js workflow run <workflow-id> "<task>"`
- Status: `node ~/.openclaw/workspace/antfarm/dist/cli/cli.js workflow status "<task title>"`
